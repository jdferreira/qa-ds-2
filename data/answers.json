One possiblity is that bats were housed in close proximity to pangolins in South China. The bats passed the virus to the pangolins who likely mutated the virus to a point it was able to transmit it to humans. Pangolins are insect eaters and could easily eat some bat dung. There are reports of sick pangolins  that died with a pneuonia like illness in Guangzhou rescue centres at the approximate time of the genetic origin of the virus.\n\nOnce inside humans it likely spent sometime mutating further before it became the A ancestral variant discovered in Guangzhou and the USA. This then mutated to become the B variant found in Wuhan.\n\nThe virus being a RNA virus mutates very rapidly. But to remain infective it has to have a high affinity for the ACE2 receptor, and variants of this receptor are found in the mammalian kingdom. Ferrets and cats have ACE2 receptors closely related to human ACE2 and there are reports that felines have been infected in zoos and homes. However, the disease in other animals may not be as severe as in humans due to differences in ACE2, and immune systems, and although they may get the virus it may not be as severe an illness so they might not excrete enough virus to then reinfect humans.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102515/", "23325": "We don't know yet whether sunlight will inactivate COVID-19.\n\n> Sunlight contains three types of ultraviolet light \u2014 UVA, which tans your skin (and ages it) and can cause eye damage; UVB, which burns and also ages skin; and UVC, which is \"the most harmful one\" because it's quite good at destroying genetic material, explains Juan Leon, a virologist who focuses on environmental health at Emory University.

The paper you referred to looked at 500 strains of Pneumococcus: \"They formed smooth colonies and were **for the most part avirulent** for mice.\" That is, most of the strains they looked  were not disease causing! You may be more familiar with this phenomena with E. coli and food borne disease. All of us have guts full of E. coli which we live in a symbiotic relationship with. However, if you pick up the wrong strain from a contaminated salad bar, you can get very, very, sick. \n\nFor bacteria, the species level is a fairly gross classification, and each strain may have subtle variations in the proteins presented at the surface of the bacterium. These surface proteins can play a key role in both the virulence of the bacteria, and our immune response to it. The [CDC tracks 90 strains of Pneumococcus that are responsible for most serious human disease. The current pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is effective against 23 of those strains.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/downloads/fs-pneumo-hcp.pdf).

So $R_0$ is not affected by vaccination status (or acquired immunity) of the population, but it includes factors such as being contageous already during incubation period (i.e. while still free of symptoms, how contageous a single virus particle is, how long a virus particle lasts under \"normal\" circumstances, ...)\n\nIn contrast, the **effective reproduction number R** includes the effects of vaccination, acquired immunity, behaviour and other measures to reduce infection risk.\n\nThe wiki page linked above lists $R_0$ for Covid-19 as 1.4\u20133.9 and for the Spanish flu of 1918 as 2\u20133.\n\nNow, for the countries that still have just a few Covid-19 cases and that are just beginning to take measures to slow the spread, the effective reproduction number will be roughly the same as the basic reproduction number: noone is immune yet, and no measures to reduce the number of contacts yet. \n\n>  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?\n\nSort-of, but rather the other way round: it means that the effective reproduction number is lower for the flu even though their $R_0$s are similar. \n\n[This review paper](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) gives an R of about 1.8 for the 1918 flu and about 1.3 for the \"normal\" seasonal flu.\n\n\n---\n\n### Vaccination\n\n\n> Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?\n\nThat can also happen. Of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. Which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease. However, not all vaccinatione we have and use achieve this - we still use them if they greatly reduce the severity of the disease. E.g. even with [varicella vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine#Medical_uses) 10 - 30 % of the exposed to get chickenpox (but even with them, serious disease is avoided). \n\nFor the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. This is also the reason why flu vaccination is done *annually* with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for MMRV, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient (immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong*, but that varies by person, and since many vaccines haven't been around that long, we don't know for which that is the case).  In fact, flu strains appear so often that the development of the annual flu vaccine includes educated guesses which strains are going to be important for next season. Sometimes that guess is off. [Wikipedia on flu vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine#Effectiveness) has a table giving  effectiveness (actual reduction of infection risk) between 10 - 60 % for different years.  \nEven if the acquired immunity by vaccination is for the wrong strain, one may still benefit from cross-immunity(?) in that the disease will be milder and possibly shorter.\n\n---\n\n\\* also acquired immunity after a disesase does not always last life-long, e.g. a [pertussis infection will achieve immunity for 4 - 20 years only (4 - 12 years for vaccination)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15876927)\n  \n\n\n\n\n", "21153": "Inflammation is the body reaction to a harmful event, like a muscle damage during exercise or infection.

[Oral rehydration solution][5], which contain sugar and sodium are better than plain water for treatment of severe dehydration: [to prevent water intoxication (dilutional hyponatremia), especially in infants][6].\n\nPlain water does not just go through you but stays in your body for a shorter time than water with added sugars and sodium. Still, for everyday use, plain water is good enough, because you can get sugar and sodium from food. Saying that, a little bit of sodium in some mineral waters can greatly improve their *taste.*\n\n**How can you estimate hydration status on your own?**\n\nThe signs of good hydration include normal moist in mouth, no thirst, colorless or straw yellow urine, no drop of body weight within few hours or days and normal [skin turgor][9], which means that the skin at the back of your hand flattens immediately after being pinched and released ([Encyclopedia.com][10]).\n\nInterestingly, *thirst* can be an unreliable sign of dehydration - some people can be severely dehydrated without being thirsty ([Mayo Clinic][11]). The most *measurable* sign of dehydration is a _sudden weight loss_ (more than 1 kg within few hours to few days). \n\n**How can a doctor evaluate dehydration?**\n\nA doctor needs to evaluate the severity and type of dehydration. Severity can be quickly estimated by weight loss: 1-3% loss = mild, 4-6% = moderate, 7% or more = severe ([Emedicine][12]).\n\nThe severity and type of dehydration can be further estimated by a **combination** of blood and urine tests; results can be *completely different* in isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic dehydration.\n\n***Isotonic* dehydration:** ([Lecturio][13])\n\n - Blood osmolality: 285-295 mOsm/kg (normal range)\n - Blood sodium: 135-145 mmol/liter\n - 24-hour urine volume: <800 mL/24 h ([ADAM][14]) \n - Urine specific gravity: increased\n\nPossible causes: excessive sweating, repeated vomiting, diarrhea, severe bleeding, burns ([ResearchGate][15])\n\n***Hypertonic* dehydration:** ([Lecturio][13])\n\n - Blood osmolality: >300 mOsm/kg\n - Blood sodium >150 mmol/liter\n - 24-hour urine volume: decreased (in water deprivation) or increased (in diabetes mellitus or insipidus)\n - Urine specific gravity: increased (in water deprivation, diabetes mellitus) or decreased (in diabetes insipidus) *([Journal of General Internal Medicine][16])*\n\nPossible causes: water deprivation, excessive sweating, drinking sea water, hyperventilation, diabetes mellitus or insipidus, ketoacidosis, end-stage renal failure, certain diuretics ([Lecturio][13], [ResearchGate][15])\n\n***Hypotonic* dehydration:**  ([Lecturio][13])\n\n - Blood osmolality: <275 mOsm/kg\n - Blood sodium <135 mmol/L\n - 24-hour urine volume: increased or decreased\n - Urine specific gravity: decreased or increased\n  \nPossible causes: treating dehydration in small children or marathon runners with fluids that contain little or no sodium, gastrointestinal obstruction or fistula, pancreatitis, Addison\u2019s disease, chronic malnutrition, cystic fibrosis with excessive salt loss in sweat, salt-wasting nephropathy, prolonged treatment of high blood pressure with low-sodium diet and thiazide diuretics ( hydrochlorothiazide), furosemide, osmotic diuretics (mannitol) ([Lecturio][13], [ResearchGate][15])\n\nIn most cases of dehydration, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio will be increased to >20:1 ([ScienceDirect][17], [Rochester.edu][18]).\n\n**Total body water**\n\nThere are various methods to measure total body water, such as flowing afterglow\u2013mass spectrometry ([AJCN, 2002][19]), but they are not used to evaluate hydration status, because this can not be determined just by knowing the absolute or relative amount of water in the body, which vary greatly with age, body weight and the percent of fat and muscle tissue.\n\n> Accurate measurements of total body water (TBW) are of value in many\n> physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances.

In renal medicine, where both these aspects of\n> body composition can be adversely affected (3), TBW is of particular\n> importance because it also determines the volume of distribution of\n> water-soluble uremic toxins (4).\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n - Plain water can be just fine for _optimal_ hydration. Adding sugars and glucose into it can promote water absorption and retention (_longer_ stay of water in your body), but this is not relevant for an otherweise healthy person in the everyday life.\n - When the hydration status is tested, the results from a *combination* of blood and urine tests need to be considered.  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1120780\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8614315\n  [3]: https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-6-9\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372905/\n  [5]: https://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm\n  [6]: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/100/6/e4\n  [7]: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/trade-sports-drinks-for-water-201207305079\n  [8]: https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/plain-water-the-healthier-choice.html\n  [9]: https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=90720\n  [10]: https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/dehydration\n  [11]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086\n  [12]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/906999-clinical#showall\n  [13]: https://www.lecturio.com/magazine/dehydration/\n  [14]: http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=003425\n  [15]: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Common-causes-of-isotonic-hypotonic-and-hypertonic-dehydration_tbl1_281126067\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831666/\n  [17]: http://Volume%20depletion%20leads%20to%20enhanced%20proximal%20tubule%20salt%20and%20water%20retention,%20thereby%20increasing%20the%20passive%20reabsorption%20of%20urea,%20leading%20to%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20normal%20blood%20urea%20nitrogen%20(BUN)%20to%20creatinine%20ratio%20from%20the%20normal%20level%20of%2010:1%20to%20over%2020:1.\n  [18]: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=urea_nitrogen_serum\n  [19]: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/76/6/1295/4689575", "20059": "Hard stool that stays in the colon for more than a couple of days is called \"fecal impaction.\" Most *medical sources* recommend treating it with manually removing the stool (by a doctor, if necessary) and using *rectally* administrated enemas:\n\n> Softening of hardened stool and stimulation of evacuation with enemas\n> and suppositories is often helpful...Most enema solutions contain\n> water and an osmotic agent.

Egg whites are not typically associated with increased risk of disease. \n 4. The idea behind throwing egg yolks away is to get the \"good\" (protein) from the egg white and to avoid the \"bad\" (fat, cholesterol and calories) from the yolk. But, egg yolk also contains protein, the fat in it is mostly unsaturated and the cholesterol from it does not raise blood cholesterol in most people.

Intake of *hypoxanthine,* the main purine in organ meats, red meat and seafood, strongly increases uric acid and increases the risk of gout, while *guanine,* the main purine in plant foods does not increase uric acid; this is why purine-rich plant foods are not associated with increased risk of gout ([JN][2], [J-Stage][3], [Science Alert][4], [NEJM][5]).\n\nStudies in which the intake of high-purine plants was not associated with increased risk of gout: [NEJM][5], [CO-Rheumatology][6]\n\nVegetarians are at lowest risk of gout, followed by fish eaters, meat eaters and vegans, who are at the highest risk, supposedly due to lack of preventative effect of proteins from milk ([Plos One][7]).  \n\n**How does one explain 'avoid alcohol' if alcoholic wine seems fine?**\n\n**Ethanol** increases serum uric acid levels by stimulation of the production of uric acid from purines ([Arthritis Care and Research][8], [Clinica Chimica Acta][9]).\n \n**Beer** is high in purines (225\u20131,145 \u03bcmol/L), especially in *guanosine* ([Beer in Health and Disease Prevention][10]). Guanosine is the most readily absorbed dietary purine, which can explain why beer increases serum uric acid levels ([British Journal of Rheumatology][11]) and the risk of gout attacks ([CO-Rheumatology][6]).\n\n**Wine** is low in purines (28-108 \u03bcmol/L) ([Biomedical Chromatography][12]). According to some studies, moderate wine intake does not increase uric acid levels ([Arthritis Care and Research][8]). However, according to one study, even moderate wine intake increases the risk of gout attacks *in the individuals with gout* ([American Journal of Medicine][13]), probably due to ethanol. \n\n**Spirits** are low in purines (0.7\u201326 \u03bcmol/L) ([Biomedical Chromatography][12]); they increase uric acid levels less than beer ([Arthritis Care and Research][8]). Spirit consumption is associated with an increased risk of gout attacks ([CO-Rheumatology][6]). Congeners (substances other than ethanol) in spirits can have different effects on uric acid ([Phytotherapy Research][14]); in one study whisky stimulated uric acid excretion and thus lowered its serum levels ([Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research][15]).\n\n**Which dietary factors are associated with *decreased* uric acid levels and risk of gout?**\n\n - Dairy intake, presumably due to protein-induced uric acid excretion ([NEJM][5], [Current Rheumatology Reports][16], [APJCN][17], [Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America][18], [Plos One][7])\n - Protein from dairy and vegetable sources, because protein stimulates uric acid excretion ([NEJM][5])\n - Vitamin C and folate intake ([CO-Rheumatology][6])\n - Cherries, possibly by inhibiting uric acid production, anti-inflammatory effect and antioxidant effect of anthocyanins ([Arthritis and Rheumatology][19])\n\n**What can one do to prevent gout?**\n\nDiet low in purines alone may not be very effective in prevention of gout attacks. Lowering beer and meat intake may reduce the risk of gout attacks, but more likely if done in combination with reduction of body weight and blood pressure (if necessary); uric acid-lowering drugs can also help ([Annals of Internal Medicine, 2017][20], [Autoimmunity Reviews, 2018][21], [Journal of Advanced Research, 2017][22]).\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16375734/\n  [2]: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.7655&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n  [3]: https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpb/37/5/37_b13-00967/_html\n  [4]: https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjn.2019.260.263\n  [5]: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa035700?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104583/\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572016/\n  [8]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.20821\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15936302\n  [10]: https://books.google.com/books?id=hBO3N5qLTEIC&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=beer%20guanosine%20hypoxanthine&source=bl&ots=L7bTns_SZy&sig=ACfU3U0O764PCgfR9rHCUsORA9PQTcuj7Q&hl=sl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv-8yd9OviAhVawsQBHWaOAVAQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=beer%20guanosine%20hypoxanthine&f=false\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6743968\n  [12]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bmc.1197\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991555/\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022993\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12198370\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21188562\n  [17]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30485934\n  [18]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251556/\n  [19]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510330/\n  [20]: https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2578528/management-acute-recurrent-gout-clinical-practice-guideline-from-american-college\n  [21]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213692\n  [22]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512152/", "19355": "According to 2 recent systematic reviews, **tooth brushing frequency is associated with less dental caries.** The studies included were case-control, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, experimental trials...\n\n[Tooth brushing frequency and risk of new carious lesions (Evidence Based Dentistry, 2016)][1]\n\n> Individuals who state that they brush their teeth infrequently are at\n> greater risk for the incidence or increment of new carious lesions\n> than those brushing more frequently.

Many causes can include visible swelling of the tonsils and tonsillar exudate, and so can be classified as tonsillitis.\n\nThe usual clinical question here is \"should I treat this sore throat with antibiotics,\" which depends on symptoms, signs, history, and epidemiology. In an otherwise healthy individual, the treatment decision is more about preventing later complications associated with infection than treating the (self-limited) infection itself. In most practices the key question, then, is not just \"is this bacterial or viral\", it is, \"is this Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or not\".  There is a good discussion of this issue and the evidence in the [clinical practice guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22965026) from the infectious diseases society of America.  Of note, there is some argument (see Cecil medicine Ch. 437, in addition to the discussion in the IDSA guidelines) for making the question \"is this Fusobacterium necrophorum, GAS, or something else\". \n\nNow, with that preamble, we can get to the question in your title:\n\n> How do the symptoms of viral tonsillitis differ from bacterial tonsillitis\n\nFor an otherwise healthy pediatric or young adult patient in the US who is up to date on vaccinations, there are some useful symptom-based rules of thumb (see both the earlier linked guidelines, and the chapter in Cecil).\n\nFrom the guidelines, signs and symptoms that strongly suggest viral etiology:\n\n>* Conjunctivitis\n* Coryza\n* Cough\n* Diarrhea\n* Hoarseness\n* Discrete ulcerative stomatitis\n* Viral exanthema\n\nCecil's describes a useful evidence based risk score for deciding whether or not to treat with antibiotics (which is essentially a question re: what is the likelihood that this is group A strep). Each of the following gives 1 point: temperature > 38 C, *absence* of cough, swollen, tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar swelling or exudate, and age 3-14 yrs.  Age 15-44 years gives 0 points, age >44 subtracts a point. If the score is 4 or more, you treat with antibiotics. If the score is 2 or 3, you culture the throat and treat if positive. if the score is 0 or 1, you observe. You can examine the evidence for this score [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15069046).\n\nAs the risk score algorithm indicates, one of the possible diagnostic next steps is a throat culture for GAS. There are also tests that detect the presence of antigen. It's important to note (as is discussed in the linked sources), that many patients are pharyngeal carriers of GAS, so detecting GAS may not provide any information about the cause of a particular bout of pharyngitis in general or tonsillitis in particular.

In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent, or by administering medication (usually propofol) through an intravenous catheter.

These children exhibited a significantly higher number of reversals of carious lesions than the control group, suggesting that remineralization has occurred.\"\n\nIt also talks about xylitol syrup:\n\n> \"Twice-daily administration of xylitol oral syrup at a total daily dose of 8 g was observed to be effective in preventing caries.\"\n\nRegarding xylitol toothpaste, it says:\n\n> \"Toothpaste with xylitol led to a decrease in S. mutans colonies in saliva, the amount of secreted saliva, and the increase of pH value. It has a positive effect on the quality of the oral environment and it would be useful introducing it into prophylactic programmes.\"\n\nThe study concludes that:\n\n> \"...more research is needed on the mechanisms of action of xylitol...\"\n\nand \n\n> \"While these issues of xylitol still need to be expanded, the benefits it offers are literally worth salivating over.\"\n\nPlease read the [full article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232036/) for all the details. \n\nAn additional medical article from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14700079 notes that they did a study where samples were soaked in xylitol solution, and says that:\n\n> \"These results indicate that xylitol can induce remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel by facilitating Ca2+ movement and accessibility.\"\n\nXylitol is a sugar substitute, with 40% less calories and 75% less carbohydrates ([than sugar](https://xylitol.org/xylitol-uses/nutritional-benefits-of-xylitol/)), that [naturally occurs in fruits and vegetables](https://xylitol.org/xylitol-artificial-natural/), which  doesn't have the [negative side effects reported from many artificial sweeteners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame#Headaches). \n\nXylitol chewing gum, mints, mouth rinse can be found at many stores but are especially prevalent in many health food stores.\n\nThis answer wasn't meant to replace any recommendations from a dentist, and was only intended to point out some newer things to possibly supplement your usual oral care.

With this large frame, you can have a high BMI without excessive fat, but for BMI as high as 30.4, you would very likely have some excessive fat. However, if the fat is evenly distributed, it may not make you look very fat.\n\n----------\n\nWhat's considered normal body weight, depends on the **body frame size.** According to this [height/weight chart][1], for a 6'0\" high man with a small frame, 149 pounds can be normal and for one with a large frame 188 pounds can be normal.\n\n[Body frame size][2] is genetically determined and is associated with the bone *thickness* (not bone *density*). Body frame size can be evaluated from your height and wrist circumference.\n\nBMI 30.4 is not in a normal range for any frame, so the excessive weight must come from excessive fat (unless you have developed a lot of muscles by training). There are different types of obesity - if fat is evenly distributed through the body, you, again, won't look that obese as if fat is mainly in your belly (abdominal obesity, apple type) or around the buttocks and thighs (pear type).\n\n[**Obesity**][3] is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. According to [CDC.gov][4], people who have obesity, compared to those with a normal or healthy weight, are at increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions...including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, diabetes type 2, etc.\n\nAccording to various [study reviews][5], **abdominal obesity** is associated with significantly higher risk of various diseases than other types of obesity.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.healthchecksystems.com/heightweightchart.htm\n  [2]: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/17182.htm\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity\n  [4]: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935926/", "16676": "The only way to know if a drug is going to kill you, or have a serious side affect is to take it and see what happens. However, there are usually many ways to predict risk of such reactions. Researchers do their best to figure this out in the drug development and testing stage, so each drug that get's approved will come with a list of contraindications (conditions that have been determined to put you at greater risk of the side effects).\n\nThere's no such thing as a general drug safety test - nor could there ever be, since each potentially deadly reaction happens in it's own way. Researchers do attempt to identify the mechanism behind serious drug reactions. Once that mechanism is identified, then they are sometimes able to develop tests for susceptibility to that particular mechanism, but this is typically on a case by case basis. In some cases, a particular mechanism might apply to a whole class of drugs so one test can help predict a potential negative affect to any drug in the class.\n\n## Anesthesia ##\nThere are [various risks][1] associated with anesthesia - all of which are very rare. They include interactions with other drugs and conditions, as well as human error (overdose, etc.). One significant cause of death directly due to a reaction to anesthesia itself is due to something called [*malignant hyperthermia*][2]. The first manifestation of this is typically in the operating room, so it's difficult to predict. It seems the only approved test involves a muscle biopsy (they have to take a cell sample from a muscle), so this is only done if you have a family history of the condition.

From the first article:\n\n> The exact mechanism of radon's effect on human body is not completely understood. However, the most favored hypothesis is that radon's action is mediated by the neuroendocrine system, stimulation of the suprarenal glands by the hypophysis, rather than by direct action on the T cells. \n\nThe last one is a general discussion of the use low-dose ionising radiation (ie not limited to radon) to treat disease. Specifically to rheumatoid arthritis, it references a [2005 review and meta-analysis][7] which conclude there is benefit, but should be treated with some skepticism as the author is affiliated with *Gasteiner Heilstollen Hospital*, which offers radon spa therapy.\n\nIt seems that there may be a potential benefit for low-dose ionising radiation via neuroendocrine induction; but the evidence is (at worst) anecdotal and not extensive.\n\nAnother study from 2015 [indicates that benefit of radon spa treatment may be 'due to chance'][12]:\n\n> adding radon to carbon dioxide baths did not improve pain intensity at three months but may improve overall well-being and pain at six months compared with carbon dioxide baths without radon, but this may have happened by chance. \n\n**Note**: That study includes an excellent 'plain language' summary.\n\nAs far as I am aware, radon therapy is not available via the NHS in the UK.\n\nOverall, there is no high-quality level one data to support the use of radon therapy for rheumatoid arthritis*.\n\n# Radon exposure (due to gas build-up in homes) definitely *is* harmful\n\nFrom [the National Cancer Institute][8]:\n\n> Radon is a radioactive gas released from the normal decay of the elements uranium, thorium, and radium in rocks and soil. It is an invisible, odorless, tasteless gas that seeps up through the ground and diffuses into the air.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Radon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. When inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. Long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon. There has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children; however, the evidence is not conclusive.\n\nSo long term exposure to radon causes lung cancer, and is [apparently the second-leading cause][9] of [lung cancer after smoking][10].\n\nAs such [it is important to be aware of the risks of indoor radon exposure][11].\n\n# So is spa radon harmful?\n\nGiven the smaller doses involved, it is hard to answer given the paucity of evidence; but I didn't find any bold, obvious warnings or studies to suggest that. \n\nFrom the [2015 article on balneotherapy referrer to earlier][12]:\n\n> we do not have precise information about side effects and complications of balneotherapy. This is particularly true for rare side effects. Side effects may include skin rash, infection and accidents, for example, slipping on wet surfaces near the bath area. The only study that reported side effects stated that they did not find any.\n\nSo I would not go so far as to label it 'safe'.\n\n---\n\n<sup>*: Credit to [Graham Chiu for suggesting this qualifier](https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15280/what-are-the-health-benefits-and-risks-of-radon-therapy/15285#comment23858_15285).</sup>\n\n# References\n\n- [Radon therapy ameliorates disease progression and prolongs survival in TNF \u03b1 tg mice][1] + [PDF][2]\n- [Dose-Response][3]\n- [Radon Treatment Controversy][4]\n- [The Therapeutic use of Radon: A Biomedical Treatment in Europe; An \u201cAlternative\u201d Remedy in the United States][5]\n- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526331/][6]\n- [Radon therapy for the treatment of rheumatic diseases\u2014review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials][7]\n- [Radon and Cancer -  National Cancer Institute][8] \n- [Indoor radon exposure and lung cancer: a review of ecological studies][9]\n- [Radon, Smoking, and Lung Cancer: The Need to Refocus Radon Control Policy][10] \n- [Radon gas warning][11]\n- [Balneotherapy (or spa therapy) for rheumatoid arthritis][12]\n\n[1]: http://ard.bmj.com/content/71/Suppl_1/A30.2\n[2]: http://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/71/Suppl_1/A30.2.full.pdf\n[3]: http://journals.sagepub.com/home/dos\n[4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2477672/\n[5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2477705/\n[6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526331/\n[7]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00296-003-0419-8\n[8]: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/radon/radon-fact-sheet\n[9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807540/\n[10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673501/\n[11]: https://www.nhs.uk/news/cancer/radon-gas-warning/\n[12]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000518.pub2/abstract", "15278": "If you have more muscles, you will have more place to store glucose in them (in the form of glycogen), but what seems to be more important is the rate of glucose uptake by muscles, which increases with **endurance training (running, swimming...)** rather than with resistance training (body building).\n\n[The Role of Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Breakdown for Regulation of Insulin Sensitivity by Exercise][1]\n\n> The glycogen content is higher in endurance trained subjects compared\n> to untrained subjects and glycogen content increases in muscles after\n> endurance training.\n\nAlso:\n\n> The reduction of skeletal muscle glycogen after exercise allows a\n> healthy storage of carbohydrates after meals and prevents development\n> of type 2 diabetes.\n\nExercise increases the glucose uptake by muscles by increasing insulin sensitivity:\n\n> Acutely, exercise improves insulin sensitivity in both healthy\n> subjects and insulin resistant people.

However most of them say that the two dietary approaches seem to be similar in terms of weight loss (2-4).\n\nOverall, it looks like intermittent fasting has comparable effects on weight and blood sugar as traditional calorie-restrictive diets.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Review of Intermittent Fasting Effects on Diabetes and Weight Loss][1]\n\n[Year Long Weight Loss In Overweight Women][2]\n\n[Intermittent Fasting and Weight Loss In Obese Women][3]\n\n[Intermittent vs. Calorie Restriction Diets in Young Overweight Women][4]\n\n[Patient-Centered Outcomes][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193152441400200X\n  [2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002934394903026\n  [3]: https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-11-98\n  [4]: https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2010171\n  [5]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1207437", "14479": "Alas, you cannot protect yourself from these toxic substances once they are in your body. Further, as currently phrased this question is awfully broad. We have managed to produce a gigantic amount of different harmful substances and covering them all in this answer is really not possible. Instead this answer tries to generalise about fat-soluble and long term stable materials that get liberated in weight loss. Any substance mentioned in citations is meant as one example, most examples do not generate generally applicable advice.\n\nThere are some options to consider to protect you from the harm these substances do. For obvious ethical reasons most of the following is based on experimental data *in vivo* and not nearly enough on human trials.\n\nThe good news is, these substances are generally very stable, but not indestructible. They do accumulate in fatty tissues and are hardly excreted or broken down. But eventually some of them are broken down or just excreted.\n\n> [**The fate of inhaled (14)C-labeled PCB11 and its metabolites in vivo:**][1]\n> This study shows that PCB11 is completely absorbed after inhalation exposure and is rapidly eliminated from most tissues. Phase II metabolites dominated with a slower elimination rate than the PCB11 or phase I metabolites and thus can best serve as urine biomarkers of exposure.\n\nThe dynamics of POP release and damage are still investigated and indeed worrisome:\n\n> [**Dynamics of persistent organic pollutants in obese adolescents during weight loss:**][2]\n>\n> In general, POP levels raised by 1\u20133.5% per kilogram weight loss. The increase in the POPs levels during weight loss did not affect the profile, which remained similar over time. Weight reduction is recommended for overweight and obese individuals in order to decrease the risk of weight-related health problems. However, the results of the present study indicate that the increase in the levels of POPs released in blood during weight loss might be of concern since literature suggested that they can be associated with endocrine disturbances. The clinical significance of the weight loss induced serum pollutants levels observed in the present study is, however, as yet unknown. Beneficial health effects of weight loss are generally expected, however, the increase in the internal exposure may adversely act on health since metabolism and/or elimination of POPs may be altered in adolescents as compared to adults. Further studies are therefore needed to address this issue.\n\nTo minimise the damage they will do there are a few routes open, all of them weak and some of them based on preliminary results and reasonable speculation:\n\n## Slow down their release\n\nAlthough it was already priced into the original question, the slower the weight loss the slower the release of persisten organic pollutants (POPs). The dosage makes the poison and therfore slowing the release of these unwanted materials is all the better.  \n\n## Increase excretion and elimination\n\nAs should be obvious highly lipophilic substances like those in question are not easily deposed of. But the body does eliminate them, very slowly, once they are mobilised from the fatty tissues.\n\nThat means drinking a lot helps, sweating a lot helps and loosing blood helps. Speeding up the metabolism, exercising or even going to a sauna seem quite beneficial. \n\nThe loosing blood needs special mention since it would be unethical to go donating blood if anyone does it to get rid of toxic substances. Yet it seems strange to advise blood-letting again, even when this involves a round of the venerable [Hirudo medicinalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudo_medicinalis) treatment. But once the substances are mobilised they are transported via blood to areas you want to to avoid them ending up. Extracting this contaminated blood is not the strangest of ideas then.\n\n> [**Human Excretion of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether Flame Retardants: Blood, Urine, and Sweat Study:**][3]\n> Conclusion. Blood testing provides only a partial understanding of human PBDE bioaccumulation; testing of both blood and perspiration provides a better understanding. This study provides important baseline evidence for regular induced perspiration as a potential means for therapeutic PBDE elimination. \n\nFinally, the infamous [Olestra][4] and its kind may have a role of value:\n\n> [**Non-dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Chlordecone Release from Adipose Tissue to Blood in Response to Body Fat Mobilization in Ewe (Ovis aries):**][5] <br> To be efficient in depurating animals, undernutrition should be combined with a strategy increasing the fecal lipid output and consequently the POP excretion pool, such as the **supplementation of the diet with nonabsorbable lipids.** This combined strategy was tested with success for hastening the removal of PCBs in chickens. Further studies are needed to assess its efficiency in larger animals such as ruminants, where only nonabsorbable lipid supplementation in well-fed growing lambs or lactating cows and goats was tested. With regard to CLD, which accumulates in the liver rather than in AT, undernutrition seems not to represent a valuable strategy because of its probable deleterious effect on liver size and metabolic activity.\n\n\n## Limit the damage the substances can do\n\nThere were a few theories proposed for certain mechanisms of action for these substances, one of them being endocrinal disrupters another being promoter of oxidative stress.\n\nEspecially the latter has received some attention and the old adage of food being your medicine came to life again.\n\nWhile \"eat healthy\" seems like a no-brainer on this front it is currently the best practical advice available. These findings are very limited by their nature. Popular \"anti-oxidants\" have usually a very low bioavailability and even in those experimental settings used to study them in regard to POPs with scaffolding mechanisms their effectiveness was greater than zero, but still not very great.\n\nCurcumin, resveratrol, CoQ10, NAC and just about all of the usual suspects for such a scenario showed some promise.\n\n\n> [**The environmental pollutant, polychlorinated biphenyls,\nand cardiovascular disease: a potential target for antioxidant nanotherapeutics:**][6]\n> A final consideration to be made in the use of antioxidant therapies is that of the route of administration. Given their size and use, most studies have focused upon i.v. injection of nanocarrier systems. Yet, such intervention strategies are likely to be limited to acute and subacute exposures, as prolonged i.v. administration is highly undesirable. As such, exploration of alternative delivery methods, includ- ing inhalation, intratracheal, intraperitoneal, and topical administration, is needed. All of these methods have been tried for the delivery of antioxidant in free form. Clinical trials employing oral delivery of antioxidants such as curcumin in free form have been conducted several times, with variable dosage towards suppression of oxidative stress-induced inflammation. [\u2026]<br>\n> Chronic exposure of environmental pollutants remains a significant health concern. Even now, PCBs pose a contin- uous threat to the health and safety of our population. As a result, we need a wide array of tools and strategies to counteract these potential risks. While effective and healthful nutrition is likely to be a major player in our strategies to minimize health hazards, as seen by clinical trials of antioxidant interventions, it is unlikely that nutrition alone is enough to treat or prevent all PCB exposure-induced disorders. As such, strategies that can reduce body burden, enhance antioxidant delivery to target cells, and capture PCBs before entering the body can potentially be used to provide defense against PCB toxicity. Furthermore, we know from other treatments, such as NAC for acetamino- phen toxicity, where antioxidant therapy can be an effective antidote. In order to enhance antioxidant therapy, strategies for effectively delivering antioxidants, such as nanocarriers, are likely required. Further studies for ideal candidates will be needed to best assess which compounds will be most effective at countering the toxicity of co-planar and non-coplanar PCBs. Finally, while studies with injectable nanocarriers provide some promising results, such routes of administration are not likely acceptable for chronic delivery systems.\n\n\n\nThe best treatment is of course preventing any new harmful material from entering your system.

[Exercise][1] has more effects (on the brain) than just [stimulating][2] a few [synapses][3]. That is indeed a vague and vastly incomplete conception. Since brain chemistry is by far not completely understood it is also quite premature to believe we would be able to define some kind of \"optimal\" endorphine production. These [neuropeptides][4] are short acting and produced and released, signalling and reabsorbed as needed. Endorphins are quickly broken down by [proteases][5]. So what we do know to directly answer the question: not long. \n\nWhat we do know about the brain from pharmacology and neuroscience is that it is not operating and optimisable like a belt-fed machine gun when it comes to releasing [transmitters][6].

Marathon runners demonstrated high hypnotic susceptibility scores. Additionally, use of dissociation as a running strategy during the marathon was positively related to susceptibility, and runners who dissociated in training had higher susceptibility scores than did other runners. Runner's high was not related to hypnotic susceptibility; however, it was positively related to dissociation. The most common description of runner's high was general relaxation, whereas the least used description was total euphoria. **Surprisingly some runners defined runner's high in ambivalent or negative terms.** These results were related to the processes of self-hypnosis and to the positive mental health benefits of running.][16]\n\nTrying to use this exercise related 'legal high' sounds like a natural substitute.

Adaptive changes of exercise must be differentiated from disease states.

New syndromes have arisen--from \"runner's high\" to athletic amenorrhea. These dedicated athletes can be difficult patients. They are highly motivated and will continue training despite significant pain and danger of permanent damage. Speaking their language--carbohydrate loading, \"the bonk,\" \"slow twitch,\" \"the wall\"--is helpful in their treatment. Traditional health problems are less likely to bring the fitness addict to the physician than some new and peculiar disorders.\n\n\n\nThis is just to remind you that going after the maximal effect of endorphine related happiness through sports may lead to addictive behaviour that is not good at all.

Immunogenicity studies using the A(H1N1)pdm09 monovalent vaccine indicated that 80%\u201395% of vaccinated children developed protective antibody levels to the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus after 2 doses (135,136); response after 1 dose was 50% for children aged 6\u201335 months and 75% for those aged 3\u20139 years (137).\n>\n> **Studies involving seasonal IIV among young children have demonstrated that 2 vaccine doses provide better protection than 1 dose during the first season a child is vaccinated.** In a study during the 2004\u201305 season of children aged 5\u20138 years who received IIV3 for the first time, the proportion of children with protective antibody responses was significantly higher after 2 doses than after 1 dose of IIV3 for each antigen (p = 0.001 for influenza A[H1N1]; p = 0.01 for influenza A[H3N2]; and p = 0 0.001 for influenza B) (138). <br> \n**Vaccine effectiveness is lower among children aged <5 years who have never received influenza vaccine previously or who received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination than it is among children who received 2 doses in their first year of being vaccinated.** <br><sub> A retrospective study of billing and registry data among children aged 6\u201321 months conducted during the 2003\u201304 season found that although receipt of 2 doses of IIV3 was protective against office visits for ILI, receipt of 1 dose was not (139). Another retrospective cohort study of children aged 6 months through 8 years, the majority of whom received IIV3 (0.8% received LAIV3), also conducted during the 2003\u201304 season, found no effectiveness against ILI among children who had received only 1 dose (140).

They can even be ranked by their abrasive effect measured by standarized methods (e.g. [Relative Dentin Abrasivity][1]), [althought this might be misleading][2], so do not follow such rankings blindly:\n\n> RDA values are not intended and should not be used as prediction tool of dental abrasion, since it does not reproduce the complex multifactiofial nature of the toothbrushing abrasion process clinically.\n\nAdditionaly to their main purpose, toothpastes may supply fluoride or other substances which can affect tooth remineralization (self-repair), reduce ability of the plaque bacteria to produce acid, or maybe raise pH acidity level in the mouth.\n\nThere is no definition of \"clean tooth\" or \"dirty tooth\", but there were attempts to measure how many times a day teeth should be brushed so they will be \"clean enough\" to maintain oral health. Quote from \"[Tooth brushing and oral health: how frequently and when should tooth brushing be performed?][3]\" (2005):\n\n> (...) there is consensus in the literature that (meticulous) tooth brushing once per day is sufficient to maintain oral health and to prevent caries and periodontal diseases. Tooth brushing is also regarded as an important vehicle for application of anti-caries agents, such as fluorides. However, most patients are not able to achieve sufficient plaque removal by performing oral hygiene measures at home. Therefore, **tooth brushing twice daily is recommended by most of the dentists** in order to improve plaque control. This rule is followed by most of the patients taking care for their oral health and has shown to be effective in maintenance of oral health in numerous studies.\n\nIt should be noted that tooth brushing may not be sufficent to maintain oral health under some conditions like improper diet (highly acidic food or drinks), [improper drinking technique][4], [regular attending of public pools][5] (so called \"swimmer's erosion\") or maybe even using [old toothbrush][6] (supposedly you can [disinfect them with vinegar][7] but I've never done that). Here it is advisable to use an alkaline mouthwash as those bad effects (and probably many others) are connected to low pH. When mouth pH levels are low tooth enamel begins to demineralize (even without bacterias). Additionaly, low pH is a good environment for some species of bacteria which produce even more acid.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nIt seems there might be a may to actually **see 'dirty' tooth** after all. You might want to use **plaque disclosing products** which contain dye reacting with plaque. There seems to be wide variety of such products: tablets, mouthwashes, flosses. You can find many videos on YouTube showing how to properly use the tablets. After using such product you can see where the plaque is, how efficent your toothbrushing (or any other method of plaque removal) was, what places were left etc.\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_dentin_abrasivity\n  [2]: https://books.google.pl/books?id=ewYuc84I-csC\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16355646\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15560830\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3953542\n  [6]: http://How%20clean%20is%20the%20toothbrush%20that%20cleans%20your%20tooth?\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24971388", "9107": "There are some conflicting results concerning the effect of caffeine on nausea.\n\nOne study [1][1] reported that caffeine withdrawal is associated with nausea and vomiting which might suggest that caffeine might reduce nausea.\n\nHowever, two years ago, a study [2][2] was conducted in postoperative care to reduce nausea and vomiting after general anesthesia by administrating caffeine.

Endoscopic remission (healing of mucosal lesions) does not necessarily correlate with clinical remission (disappearance of symptoms), and endoscopy would therefore still be indicated as a first-line diagnostic test if there is a very high suspicion for the disease based on previous symptoms. \n\nFor example, take a 21 year old man of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, with two sisters having Crohn's disease, who has a resolved history of bloody diarrhea 1 year ago, and is found to be anemic and B12 deficient on blood tests.

This hormone is involved in quite a few processes in the body, and acts on nearly every cell in it. \n\nA deficit of iodine can cause a number of diseases, including [goiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre) (swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck), [hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism) (can cause increased sensitivity to cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression), [gastric cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642482), and [cretinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretinism) (presents as severely stunted development and growth, both physical and mental, but unlikely to affect a healthy adult).\n\nNow, iodized salt is not the only source of iodine in one's food. It can also be found in fish, shellfish, and kelp products, milk and eggs from iodine-sufficient farm animals, and plants grown on iodine-rish soil. The [recommended intake](http://iom.nationalacademies.org/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRIs/DRI_Elements.pdf) of iodine varies between 150 &micro;g per day for healthy adults to 250-290 &micro;g/day for pregnant and lactating women, respectively.

Now, I don't want to discourage the use of it at all, as there is absolutely nothing wrong with it from a health perspective (except from overconsumption, but that applies to most everything). Not everyone (especially in America, the UK, and some other countries) eat very healthy diets, but since the use of iodized salt in restaurants and for food manufacturers is required by law, Westerners are not likely to be under-iodinated.\n\nOf course, the best way to tell is to go to your primary health care provider, explain your situation, and ask if they'd be willing to order a thyroid function blood test. It looks at the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, from the pituitary gland) along with thyroid hormone itself.

You'll find many sources listing drugs that cause retrograde amnesia but they're using the term incorrectly.\n\nFrom http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html:\n> Retrograde amnesia is a form of amnesia where someone is unable to\n> recall events that occurred **before** the development of the amnesia,\n> even though they may be able to encode and memorize new things that\n> occur after the onset.\n\nWith that definition in mind, I don't think drugs exist that cause retrograde amnesia for the past few days, much less years. Some drugs will create retrograde amnesia for memories formed minutes before administration, but not much longer than that. This is believed to be because they interfere with the memory formation process, which is still incomplete when the drug is taken.\n\nLong term alcohol abuse can cause retrograde amnesia, but that's due to the brain damage it causes after long-term abuse. No single binge, even a long one, will cause retrograde amnesia if the abuse is short-lived.\n\nThere are [animal experiments][1] that have produced retrograde amnesia by administering agents directly to the brain, but that's not something a doctor can give you. They may lead to such drugs in the future, but they're not available yet.\n\nThere are [several drugs][2] that can prevent new memories from being formed such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and anesthesia agents such as propofol, but they all work by preventing **new memories from being formed while under influence of the drug**. They don't wipe out memories formed before the drug was taken and therefore can't be said to cause retrograde amnesia.\n\nSo, basically, true retrograde amnesia is usually due to brain damage from agents such as dementia, trauma, stroke, infection, prolonged seizures, and long-term substance abuse. There are no drugs a doctor can give you that will accomplish this.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15174933\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9131198", "778": "**Definition:**\n\n> The term \"high fructose corn syrup\" is not a good descriptor of its\n> composition, but the term was mandated to distinguish the newly\n> developed fructose-containing corn syrup from traditional all-glucose\n> corn syrups.

This leads to the problem of obesity when people consume too many calories, pointing towards higher risks of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n**The Possible Culprit**\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) contributes to this problem because when consumed, it does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. In animal models, it even induces insulin resistance, leading to diabetes (1).\n\n> \"the long-term consumption of diets high in fat and fructose is likely\n> to lead to increased energy intake, weight gain, and obesity\" (1).\n\n\n> Additionally, when ingested by itself, fructose is poorly absorbed\n> from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is almost entirely cleared by\n> the liver since it's absorbed through a different system than glucose.\n> This puts more work on the liver.

They can store up massive amounts of energy without the need to stuff themselves until their stomachs are nearly exploding. For people who burn a massive amount of energy on a regular basis, HFCS comes as a good source for replenishing and preparing that energy for usage, but for everyone else who doesn't burn high levels of calories, this indicates a high influx of potential energy without anywhere to go. \n\n**The Counter**\n\nThis short-term study notes,\n\n> \"There were no differences in energy or macronutrient intake on day 2.\n> The only appetite variable that differed between sweeteners was desire\n> to eat\" (4)\n\nAnother study notes that most of the testing has been done on rats, whereas in humans, \n\n>for people with insulin resistance, diets\n> with 50 grams or more per day (high consumption) may result in\n> elevated triglycerides, but there is no effect with normal levels of\n> fructose consumption.

In fact, one of the studies indicates that fructose increased appetites while another claimed it inhibited appetite! \n\nIf there's one thing that seems highly possible right now, it's that high fructose corn syrup gives energy, whether you need it or not.

The gut bacteria that you do have may not be the optimal, but *no one even knows what the optimal gut microbiome/microbiota is.* The study of the effects of different populations of gut flora is in its infancy. The most intensive studies are being carried out in animal models, and their applicability to humans is not yet guaranteed.\n\nCan a person change their microbiome with probiotics? Researchers are still dubious. There is a lot of research that indicates that the intestinal flora you carry throughout your life is largely determined in early infancy. Others believe that the microbiome changes over time; this has been shown to occur especially due to illness or antibiotic use.\n\nThe two areas of greatest study in humans is *obesity* (associated with certain strains of gut bacteria in certain populations) and as a treatment for Clostridium Difficile colitis, and none of the findings can be generalized yet to the \"normal\" population. Inflammatory Bowel Disease had been studied as well, and some other disorders, to a lesser extent.

Specialized skin cells called melanocytes impart more or less melanin (through granules called melanosomes) to keratinocytes; these cells then are what give you a tan. The keratinocytes undergo constant turnover, so are eventually shed, and in the absence of continued exposure to UV radiation, there is no need to keep producing melanin-heavy keratinocytes. (It's a bit more complicated, but that's the basic idea.) \n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\n>The keratins and proteins within the stratum corneum act mainly by scattering and absorbing the UV. UV-R sets in action an integrated mechanism for the formation and delivery of melanin within melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This mechanism is probably triggered by keratinocytes, which respond to UV-R with bursts of mitoses and with increased production of ET-1 and POMC, thus creating a new demand for melanosomes. The mitotic rate of basal keratinocytes increases a day after UV exposure, reaches a maximum 2 days later, and maintains this level for \u223c1 wk. It then declines, and the skin regains its original thickness after 1\u20132 months if there has been no subsequent exposure.\n\nIn other words, for a light-skinned individual, light skin is normal, healthy, and appropriate. A tan represents response to a level of damage. When the damage ceases, the skin stops producing the unnecessary cells and the unnecessary pigmentation.\n\n>Is there is any medical disadvantage of a high melanin level during periods of reduced sun exposure[?]\n\nYes. Darker skin is less conducive to production of Vitamin D. This is why Southern Asians living in northern European cities are more prone to Vitamin D deficiency.\n\nAlso, when exposed to UV radiation, melanin can itself become somewhat toxic to cells, the photosensitization generating superoxide radicals which can injure individual cells. So the risk having melanin must be outweighed by the protective effect of melanin against UV light. It's a delicate balance. \n\nContinued exposure to UV light stimulates the melanocytes to grow. This increases the chance of the development of melanomas. Since skin cells containing melanin are shed (there's no getting around that), in light-skinned individuals, keeping a tan is to keep injuring the skin and risking carcinogenesis.\n\n<sub>[Melanin Pigmentation in Mammalian Skin and Its Hormonal Regulation](http://physrev.physiology.org/content/84/4/1155)</sub>  \n<sub>[Human skin pigmentation: melanocytes modulate skin color in response to stress](http://www.fasebj.org/content/21/4/976.full)</sub>    \n<sub>[Mechanism of UV-related carcinogenesis and its contribution to nevi/melanoma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564815/)</sub>    \n\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6jJW.jpg", "4252": "In regards to your psychologist, remember that it often takes time before you find one that suits you.

You mention a counterpart,  which is a badly defined concept in this context. There are other substances that can bind to these opioid receptors (opiods, for one :-)) and substances that can block opioid receptors without triggering them, like naloxone and naltrexone. Those are called opioid antagonist and for example used for treating substance dependence. They don't cause pain, though. \n\nPain is transmitted in the body through neurons the same way other signals are transmitted. The difference to other signals is in how the brain interprets these signals. If they are coming from pain receptors (nociceptors), they are interpreted as pain. There is no special neurotransmitter for pain, though as all signal transmission, there isn't just one. Pain transmission is also relatively slow compared to some other neuronal activity, having to do with the mixture of neurotransmitter and the way nocireceptors are structured. \n\nFor example, for pain generated by heat exposure:\n\n> The nociceptive axons, (...) begin to discharge only when the strength of the stimulus (a thermal one in the example in Figure 10.1) reaches high levels; at this same stimulus intensity, other thermoreceptors discharge at a rate no different from the maximum rate already achieved within the nonpainful temperature range, indicating that there are both nociceptive and nonnociceptive thermoreceptors.\n\nBasically, in this case there are two signals being transmitted, one normal temperature signal and one pain signal. \n\nStress is not a signal that is transmitted through any pathway in the human body.

However, we don't seem to know when this will happen. \n\nThis is **not medical advice** and I am not recommending you go out and combine these two, or not do that, you should ask the doctor prescribing the methylphenidate that. But your source recommending against combining them isn't reputable. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/ritalin_la.pdf\n  [2]: http://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/concerta-3/\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7028238\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880463/", "3441": "Yes, blood viscosity changes with altitude. \nThis is a study in rats where the control group was kept at normal altitude and the test group at simulated 5500 meters. \n\n> Besides, RBC counts, hematocrit, **whole blood viscosity**, erythrocyte aggregation index of hypoxia model rats were all notably higher than those of normal control rats respectively.\n\n[Changes in the rheologic properties of blood after a high altitude expedition][4]\nThe effects you are describing is called \"high altitude deterioration\" (HADT) and in patients with this, blood viscosity is one of the symptoms. \n> but other indicators including the **blood viscosity**, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration and heart rate were higher in patients with HADT\n\n[The study of prevalence rate, and clinical characteristics of high altitude deterioration][2]\n\nThis study was only in old women, but nevertheless I will include it here:\n\n> It is found that the correlation between geographical factors and the normal reference value of whole blood viscosity (230s(-1)) of old women is quite significant (F=30.137, P=0.000).\n\n[Normal reference value of whole blood viscosity (230s(-1)) of old women and geographical factors][3]\n\nMost relevant to your question, this was a small study on mountaineers to Mount Everest:\n> In blood samples collected immediately after return, alterations of some haemorheologic parameters were observed in comparison with baseline values, and namely an **increase in relative blood viscosity**, fibrinogen and erythrocyte filtration time along with a fall in platelet count\n\n[Changes in the rheologic properties of blood after a high altitude expedition][4]\n\n\nMaking the connection to vascular problems:\n\n> Increased viscosity is associated with aging, obesity, carotid intima-media thickness, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, **ischemic heart disease, and stroke**\n\n[Increased whole blood viscosity is associated with silent cerebral infarction][5]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26016362\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26439041\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24120566/\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/6465620/\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23988733", "3245": "First I should state I'm not in ortho, but have worked some on tissue engineering.

I\u00b4ll try sum up those long answers in the Biology Stack and present them more clearly.\n\nMajor factor influencing to the presumed effects of any drug is the first pass effect [(Wikipedia)][1]. That means that every substance taken orally must absorb from intestine to the surrounding blood stream. All this blood with all absorbed substance (incl. sugar, fat, protein from food) are transported to liver. Liver then processes all the substances in the blood.\n\nThere are dozen of enzymes in the liver which processes the substances in the blood. One enzyme family particularly processes all the foreign substances (inc. drugs) [(Wikipedia)][2]. Liver aims to remove all foreign substances from the blood, but some of the absorbed substance always escapes the liver to the systemic circulation. Only those molecules which escape liver without processing are transported to the tissues and afterwards can bind to their receptors in the tissue thus eliciting the proposed actions (ie. reducing pain).\n\nEnzymes in the liver processes the foreign molecules in a way that they are secreted to bile and eventually to feces. For example enzyme CYP2E1 processes paracetamol [(Wikipedia)][3]. There are three different CYP-enzymes which processes diclofenac molecules [(PubMed)][4]. And for naproxen two CYP-enzymes exist [(PubMed)][5]. \n\nOne major reason why diclofenac does not help you but naproxen does, is the different action of these enzymes. DNA in our cell nucleus defines how each protein is expressed in our body. These enzymes are these proteins. In your case it seems that enzymes responsible for processing diclofenac are expressed in large number in your liver, resulting to very low concentration of diclofenac molecules in your bloodstream. In other word the level of diclofenac in your blood stream is out of therapeutic window to elicit any responses in the body [(Wikipedia)][6]. In contrary, your liver may express enzymes responsible for the processing of naproxen very little and thus many naproxen molecules may escape liver to the systematic circulation resulting the therapeutic level to elicit tissue responses.\n\nThis only one player in this topic, although very important and influential. There are also factor influencing after the first pass effect (receptor, expression of genes responsible for receptors, binding affinity ec.) \n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871048\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8866821\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window", "1547": "As I argue in my answer to [this question][1], there seems to be a threshold in terms of the amount of alcohol likely to cause hepatocellular necrosis based on the production of acetaldehyde. However, alcohol causes damage to other cells in the body such as in the [brain][2] and [throat][3]. Since your example is of hard liquor, there would be damage to the mouth and esophagus not present from consumption of more dilute solution. Although beyond the scope of your question, many people would consider changes like habituation to the effects and long-term tolerance, and even \"developing an acquired taste\" which could increase the propensity for alcoholism, to be harmful.\n\n[A study][4] of two hospitalized toddlers found that their alcohol consumption was somewhat under 20 mL for the first one (who drank an acetaminophen elixir) and 2 to 7 mL for the second one (who drank mouthwash and collapsed). So it seems that toddlers are more sensitive to the depressant effect of alcohol than adults per kg of body weight, and that it is feasible for them to drink enough alcohol to suffer respiratory arrest.\n\nThere is a whole [thread][5] on reddit discussing your very question. None of the answers were satisfyingly quantitative, but people pointed out that some pediatric medications contain ethanol (which should make it possible to calculate a \"sanctioned\" dose), that people in France and other places have a history of giving a little alcohol to young children, that ethanol is a metabolite (rum flavoring) or additive (flavoring extracts) in some foods, that it forms spontaneously in sugar-containing foods like juice and that it can form naturally in the intestine. So any of these approaches should make it possible to estimate a \"normal\" exposure of toddlers to ethanol, if not a \"safe\" one.\n\n\n  [1]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1481/are-all-kinds-of-liquor-and-alcohol-equally-bad-for-liver/1518#1518\n  [2]: http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa63/aa63.htm\n  [3]: http://www.alcoholanswers.org/alcohol-education/health-topics/alcohol-and-mouth-esophagus.cfm\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1343022/\n  [5]: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/13xyho/are_really_small_amounts_of_alcohol_harmful_for/", "1554": "A recent review looked at 26 studies that examined mental state after smoking cessation.

The missing bit of information here is that topical steroids are usually not absorbed systemically at high enough levels to cause adrenal suppression. However, they sometimes are. I shall explain.\n\nFirst of all, regarding the relationship between *systemic* corticosteroid administration and adrenal insufficiency, please see [this answer][ta]. The basic idea (which I think you understand) is that exogenous administration of medications that mimic cortisol (a hormone produced in the adrenal gland) suppress the body\u2019s processes for stimulating the hormone naturally. The adrenal gland atrophies due to the lack of natural stimulation. This causes a problem if the medication is suddenly withdrawn, because the body can\u2019t quickly recover the ability to produce cortisol itself. This is called **adrenal insufficiency** or **HPA axis suppression**.<sup>1</sup> \n\nNow to your question:\n> How do topical steroid withdrawal relate to adrenal insufficiency?\n\nThe answer is that *if* topical steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream at high enough levels for a long enough time to suppress the HPA axis, they will cause adrenal insufficiency. Usually this degree of absorption occurs only with the use of \u201cGroup I\u201d topical steroids, the strongest ones. [This list][tl] shows the different categories of topical steroids by potency. The \u201csuper-potent\u201d Group I includes:<sup>2</sup>   \n\n- Betamethasone 0.05% \n- Clobetasol 0.05%\n- Diflurasone 0.05%\n- Halobetasol 0.05%\n- Flucinonide 0.1%\n  \nThe most important factors that determine whether or not HPA suppression will occur are the potency of the drug, the dose, and the duration of use. The Group I agents can cause significant HPA suppression if used for two or more weeks at a dose of ~2g/day. Other factors that predispose to HPA suppression include:\n  \n- application to permeable areas (face, mucous membranes)\n- occlusive dresssings\n- compromised skin integrity\n- young age\n \nThe first list in your question appears to mostly outline *local* effects of withdrawing topical steroids. These are possible with less potent steroids and do not require systemic absorption. The second list, on the other hand, describes a syndrome of adrenal insufficiency. These are likely only the circumstances described above. \n\n-----\n**Notes**  \n\n1. HPA stands for hypothalamus &#8594; pituitary &#8594; adrenal, the pathway for producing cortisol.\n\n2.

I would say everyday. Dietary fibres are very good laxatives in normal individuals. Any diet should include plenty of dietary fibres. They also reduce the [risk of colorectal carcinomas][2] and [reduce cholesterol][3] and are all the more reasons to include in the diet - especially in the western population. For someone who follows a regular food habit and is generally healthy there won't be any reason to take anything else to increase bowel movements. So in short, dietary fibres(roughage) should be your everyday laxative. \n\nIf you are acutely constipated for some reason, and is making you miserable, and do not have any other symptoms(such as vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in stool, etc) then you can take an over the counter laxative for one day and see if it resolves the issue. That can be simple mineral oil, castor oil, Isapghula, etc. If a single dose of any of those does not improve your costipation, then you should consult a doctor. The doctor can look at the cause of constipation and prescribe a medicine for you appropriately for a short duration of time. Some people who take certain pills ([opiod narcotics for example][4]) are likely to be chronically constipated. In that case one may have to use laxatives for a long duration of time, but that decision is taken by a doctor. \n\nThe reason why it is not recommended to take a laxative for a long duration of time without a good reason is that some laxatives reduce cause colonic tissues to wear out over time and make the patient permanently consipated([laxative gut][5]) There is also the risk of [reduced nutrient absorption, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, intestinal paralysis, irritable bowel syndrome, factitious diarrhea, etc][6]. So chronic use of stimulant laxatives should be avoided whenever possible. \n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative\n  [2]: http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/6453.pdf\n  [3]: http://nutritionreviews.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/4/188\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26126675\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative#Laxative_gut\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative#Laxative_abuse", "1257": "Yes, mortality benefits for blood pressure medicine have been demonstrated in trials.\n\nLet me just preface this by saying this was much harder to find than I was expecting. Questioning the benefit of blood pressure reduction is medical heresy, so you'd think you wouldn't have trouble finding the data out there.\n\nFirst of all, let's define the question. We're asking whether treatment of hypertension leads to lower mortality in the setting of a randomized clinical trial. Reading between the lines, I think what we really want to know is whether treatment of isolated hypertension (i.e. in patients that have no strokes, heart failure or other diseases associated with hypertension) leads to lower mortality in a randomized clinical trial. Treating hypertension after a stroke or heart attack is hands down beneficial (see HOPE, PART2, IDNT, NICOLE or PREVENT trials [1-5]). You can't answer the question with this data though, because maybe the drug is really just treating the heart attack or stroke. \n\nTo get data specifically on treating hypertension itself, not in the setting of other medical problems, you have to go back to the 1960s. The VA COOP Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents [6,7] trial specifically looked at treating people who just came into the clinic with high blood pressure. Mortality was 5% lower in the treatment group, or, for every 20 people treated for 3.3 years (the average time people were enrolled in the study), 1 person will have their life saved. Honestly, this is a pretty good outcome as far as drugs go, taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks doesn't work nearly as well, for example. The authors collected these numbers on mortality but they didn't test for whether the numbers were likely to have just popped up by chance or not (statistical significance). I crunched them myself with Fisher's exact test and the results were unlikely to have just come up by chance (p value = 0.015) \n\nSome caveats. This study was old (the word negro is used), but it was really well done. They had the patients go through a 2 month run in phase where they had to take pills that turned their urine orange just so they could see whether they took their pills regularly before letting them in the trial. All the patients and the doctors were blinded. They used sealed envelope randomization. Patients were enrolled from eight different sites. Of course, it was done at the VA in the 60s, so every single patient was a man. Also, the patients weren't exactly free of other diseases. For some reason, the authors didn't just say how many patients had strokes or heart attacks in the past. They devised this \"severity score\" to assess how many health problems people had at the start of the trial. The score went from 0-4 and on average the patients were less than 1. I would say most weren't very sick.\n\nSome other trials tried to test blood pressure medicines versus placebo but fell short. The Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension [8] had many fewer events than the VA study so weren't quite able to show statistical significance. The benefits to treatment that they measured in this study were way smaller. Treatment reduced death by .15%. So for every 666 people taking the drug for 1 year, 1 person's life would be saved. They were only able to show this was statistically significant when they looked at the numbers for people actually taking the drug. You want to look at everyone that entered the study in the first place though (intention to treat), because you can always invent scenarios where you get biased results if you don't do this. \n\nThere was one other study that looked at this question. The Oslo study [9] also failed to show that treatment actually saved lives when treating patients with just hypertension.\n\nKeep in mind that all of these studies were able to show benefit to treating (fewer strokes, less kidney failure) but mortality was really only lower in the VA trial. My gut tells me that this was because aged American veterans were less healthy to start with then relatively healthy Norwegians and Australians (the population from the other studies). It was less of a needle-in-a-haystack challenge in the VA trial.\n\nSometime in the 70s or 80s, it seems that doctors all decided that treating hypertension was the way to go no matter how healthy the patient was otherwise so we don't have any more studies. \n\nReferences\n\n 1.

You should not use it past that date. Not just that microbiological quality can't be guaranteed after that much time (not even with phenol which might have preserved it to a point, but not for 40 years), but also the chemical composition might have changed - both the active substances and the excipients might have underwent various chemical reactions - and no one can say with any certainty what you've got in there now.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nNow, onto your question: *How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?* \n\nIt depends on the ingredient. The **concentration** is important because both safety and efficacy/effectiveness depend on it.

Sadly, most studies have been done on full body vibration training, so some of the references I point to may not be specifically about vibration belts, but the mechanisms of each method are basically the same.\n\nA review of several studies<sup>[1]</sup> on vibration exercise in general, including the use of vibration belts, found that vibration exercise was not very efficient in burning fat. It wasn't found to be very good at promoting weight loss or changing the body composition at all (ie: building muscle). One study did show possible signs that vibration exercise and vibration belts can burn fat, but overall, the rate at which fat is burned at when using a vibration belt or other form of vibration exercise is low. There are some possible benefits of vibration exercise, such as higher oxygen intake. This review did not provide fully conclusive results, though.\n\nAnother review of many studies on whole-body vibration training<sup>[2]</sup> found similar results, though they did point more in the favor of vibration exercise having benefits. The review states in its conclusion that:\n\n> [Whole-body vibration training] appears to be associated with three pathways involved in weight loss: inhibition of adipogenesis and reduction of fat mass, increased energy expenditure, and increase in muscle mass. After analysing the literature, none of the results for the proposed pathways are consistent, and indeed are often contradictory.\n\nThis review shows more positive results than the other review I mentioned that vibration training may promote weight loss, especially when used in conjunction with other exercises meant to help you lose weight. Vibration exercise does appear to be safe, though, so it can be used with a weight loss diet and exercises to help promote weight loss. Though this review was about whole-body vibration training, vibration belts work in a similar fashion, so it is likely that vibration belts may produce similar results.\n\n<hr>\n\n<sup>[1: Is vibration exercise a useful addition to a weight management program?][1]</sup>\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22092513\n\n<sup>[2: Whole-body vibration training as complement to programs aimed at weight loss][2]</sup>\n\n  [2]: http://www.nutricionhospitalaria.com/pdf/6656.pdf\n", "598": "Scientific research has been conducted on the absorption of nutrients provided by both food groups when combined.

The quantitative effect, although dose dependent, was modified by the form in which Ca was administered and by other dietary constituents (such as phosphate, phytate and ascorbic acid) known to affect Fe bioavailability.\n\nand\n\n>The results of most multiple-meal human studies suggest that Ca supplementation will have only a small effect on Fe absorption unless habitual Ca consumption is very low. Outcome analyses showed that Ca supplements had no effect on Fe status in infants fed Fe-fortified formula, lactating women, adolescent girls and adult men and women. However it should be noted that the subjects studied had adequate intakes of bioavailable Fe and, except in one study, had relatively high habitual Ca intakes.\n\nSee: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087437\n\n", "1088": "The simple answer is no.\n\n>[H]ernias seem to be very simple to fix if deal with early on.\n\nVery true; so easy that it's often an outpatient procedure.\n\n\"Strapping\" (or belting) hernias has been done in one form or another for centuries.

While a healthy person who drinks 6-8 liters of water daily is unlikely to suffer significant hyponatremia, people who drink this much often have psychiatric illness that is accompanied by poorly understood hormonal changes that may indeed cause hyponatremia and its attendant symptoms.\n\n\n**Psychogenic polydipsia**  \n\nMany patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders drink more water than normal. This is termed psychogenic polydipsia. The cause is unknown.<sup>1</sup> \n\n**Hyponatremia: mechanism**  \n\nSodium levels correlate closely with serum osmolality, since sodium is the primary cation contributing to osmotic pressure. The body maintains serum osmolality within a narrow range via regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, a.k.a. arginine vasopressin), a hormone that is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland (a.k.a. neurohypophysis) at the base of the brain in response to a rise in serum osmolality. The hormone circulates in the blood and acts in the kidneys to increase free water resorption, thereby lowering serum osmolality. In the case of excess free water, ADH secretion will be maximally suppressed. \n\nIn a healthy person, ADH suppression results in urine diluted to a concentration of about 60 mmol/kg,<sup>4</sup> which (assuming a normal glomerular filtration rate) corresponds to a fluid intake of about 28 L per day. Only above that level with serum osmolality be significantly compromised.\n\n**SIADH**   \n\nUnfortunately, many people can not suppress ADH maximally. As a result, urine may be \u2018inappropriately\u2019 compromised in the face of falling serum osmolality. This is called, creatively, Syndrome of Inappropriate Diuretic Hormone (SIADH). For reasons that are incompletely understood, many psychiatric patients with psychogenic polydipsia (see below) have SIADH.<sup>3</sup> Some of the reasons that are understood: \n\n- Medications including antidepressants (primarily SSRIs) and antipsychotics are well-established causes of SIADH.  \n- Schizophrenia itself appears to be associated with SIADH. \n- Chronic hyponatremia may lead to a \u2018reset osmostat\u2019 whereby the pituitary's threshold for ADH secretion is changed. \n\n**Hyponatremia: consequences**\n\nThe constellation of symptoms associated with hyponatremia is termed hyponatremic encephalopathy.<sup>3</sup> It includes: headache, blurred vision, weakness, muscle tremor and cramps, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, confusion. This can progress, in severe cases, to seizures, coma, and death. It would be exceedingly rare for a person with purely psychogenic polydipsia to progress to this point (in part because one is likely to develop depressed consciousness and stop drinking such that the kidney can fix the problem prior to dying). \n\nOne important point is that the level of hyponatremia required to cause these symptoms is largely dependent on the rapidity of change. Acute hyponatremia can cause symptoms at a level of 128-130 mEQ/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L). On the other hand, patients with chronic SIADH may walk around with sodium 120-125 mEq/L without symptoms. \n\n-----\n<sub>\nReferences\n</sub>\n\n<sub>\n1. M Biswas and J S Davies.

By standard pulse oximetry, [carboxy-hemoglobin is indistinguishable from oxyhemoglobin][co]. Also, carbon monoxide causes a left-shift of the [oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve][oxyhemoglobin]. This means the hemoglobin is holding onto the oxygen more tightly, resulting in a higher saturation of hemoglobin. It is for both of these reasons that students are often taught about the [\u201ccherry red\u201d appearance of skin][cherry] and mucous membranes in carbon monoxide poisoning.** In contrast to hypoxemia (low SpO<sub>2</sub>) when mucous membranes tend to turn blue due to low oxygen saturation, the hemoglobin saturation in carbon monoxide poisoning will be seen (both by our eyes and by pulse oximetry) as high. **[Pulse oximetry may be spuriously high][gap] in smokers due to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin.** \n\nIn most young, healthy people, oxygen saturation is 98-100% anyway, so this difference is usually negligible.

This function was suppressed for up to 5 hours in control subjects, while fasting comparisons did not have the same effect.

In two meta-analyses, replacing saturated fat with **omega-6** polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with a higher risk of heart disease, and replacing with **omega-3** fatty acids with a reduced risk ([Cambridge Core, 2010][12], [Nutrition Journal, 2017][13]).\n\n**Dairy,** despite being high in saturated fat, has not been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease ([British Journal of Nutrition, 2016][14], [Current Nutrition Reports, 2018][15]). It was suggested that high levels of calcium and vitamin D in milk may counteract the effect of saturated fat ([Nutrition Bulletin, 2017][16]).\n\n**Red meat** and **processed meat** are both high in saturated fat, but processed meat intake has been associated with much higher risk of heart disease and diabetes 2 than unprocessed red meat ([Circulation, 2010][17], [BMC Medicine, 2013][18]). This suggests that it may not be saturated fat but preservatives (sodium, nitrates) in processed meat that can be harmful.\n\nHigh intake of **refined carbohydrates** (sugar, plain starch) in combination with saturated fat intake has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease ([The Netherlands Journal of Medicine, 2011][19]).  \n\n**2) Individual differences in response to saturated fat**\n\nIndividuals who produce **small dense LDL particles** can be more negatively affected by saturated fat than those who produce large particles.\n\n> Because medium and small LDL particles are more highly associated with\n> cardiovascular disease than are larger LDL, the present results\n> suggest that very high saturated fat intake may increase\n> cardiovascular disease risk in phenotype B individuals *[who produce a\n> large percent of small LDL particles]*. *([Plos One, 2017][20])*\n\nIndividuals with **increased risk of heart disease** seem to be more prone for harmful effects of saturated fat. In a prospective PREDIMED study following 7038 participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease for 6 years, high intake of saturated fat was strongly positively associated (+81%) and unsaturated fat strongly inversely associated (-32-50%) with cardiovascular events and deaths.\n\n**In conclusion,** the effect of saturated fat on health cannot be evaluated in isolation but only in context of overall diet and individual differences. High saturated fat intake can be harmful in individuals with risk factors for heart disease, but less likely in healthy individuals without risk factors who consume enough whole grains and unsaturated fat. There is no evidence to recommend increasing saturated fat intake.   \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack\n  [2]: https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475232/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943062/\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121105/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648\n  [7]: https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/1846638/association-dietary-circulating-supplement-fatty-acids-coronary-risk-systematic-review\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814348/\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068959\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29174025\n  [11]: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012345/VASC_polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-prevention-and-treatment-diseases-heart-and-circulation\n  [12]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/n6-fatty-acidspecific-and-mixed-polyunsaturate-dietary-interventions-have-different-effects-on-chd-risk-a-metaanalysis-of-randomised-controlled-trials/938F3F74E18033ED061F7D8CEAB0A24A/core-reader#\n  [13]: https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-017-0254-5\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26786887\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244750/\n  [16]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nbu.12283\n  [17]: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed\n  [18]: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-11-63\n  [19]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21978979\n  [20]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5293238/", "20965": "Even if you get the results of several tests on one paper, every single test is a separate test.

Annals of surgery, 46(3), 329.", "19064": "Glucose and insulin [could co-exist in the same container without reacting][1].\n\nIntravenous insulin has been used to treat hyperglycemia. There is a risk of severe hypoglycemia and even death after intravenous insulin ([Diabetes Spectrum][2]), which makes it inappropriate for use outside hospitals.\n\n----------\n\n**What naturally happens during stressful physical work?**\n\nStress triggers the adrenal glands to release the hormones **adrenaline** and **cortisol,** which break down glycogen (in the liver and muscles) into glucose, and fats into fatty acids, which then appear in the blood. This triggers the pancreas to release the hormone **insulin,** which stimulates the entrance of glucose and fatty acids into the muscles thus providing substrate that can be broken down into energy. **Adrenaline** stimulates this breakdown. Adrenaline also dilates the bronchi in the lungs thus enabling more oxygen to enter the blood. It also dilates the arteries in the muscles thus increasing the blood flow and hence the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the muscles.\n\nSo, insulin merely enables glucose to enter the cells, but they are adrenaline and cortisol that enable the release of energy (energy boost).\n\n**What is exhaustion?**\n\nSimply put, exhaustion after physical work is lack of energy, mainly due to depleted glycogen stores (the source of glucose) in the liver and muscles.\n\nWithout glycogen, one would be much less able to run fast and fight.\n\n**How to naturally replenish glycogen stores?** \n\nHaving several **high-carbohydrate meals** provides glucose that appears in the blood. This triggers the release of insulin, which stimulates the entrance of glucose into the cells. Glucose that is not needed for the energy at the time is used to replenish glycogen stores - this process is also stimulated by insulin. This way, glycogen stores can be fully replenished in *about 24 hours* ([PubMed, 2018][3]).\n\nGlycogen replenishment is optimal when one starts to consume carbohydrates *immediately after exercise.* If the consumption is delayed for 2 hours, glycogen synthesis can be reduced by 50% ([Today's Dietitian][4]). This also very likely applies to glucose injection. \n\nThe optimal amount of carbohydrates is 0.6 g per kg of body weight every 30 minutes, so, for a 70 kg person *about 40 g carbohydrates every 30 minutes for four hours (up to 700 g per day)* ([PubMed, 2018][3]).\n\n**How could glycogen replenishment be artificially accelerated? (pure theory, not proven effective or safe)**\n\nAccording to [one study][5], **intravenous glucose** stimulates glycogen synthesis, but there is no timing mentioned.\n\n**Fructose** and **galactose** injection can result in twice as quick glycogen synthesis as a glucose injection ([PubMed][6], [Diabetes][7]).\n\nConcluding from the following article ([PubMed, 1991][8]), insulin by injection might not stimulate glucose uptake by the liver and hence glycogen synthesis beyond the rate already achieved by naturally secreted insulin. \n\n> Experiments carried out in man have suggested that insulin may play\n> only a permissive role in the determination of splanchnic glucose\n> uptake. In a study by DeFronzo et al. (5), in which the plasma glucose\n> and insulin levels were raised via peripheral intravenous infusion to\n> 223 mg/dl and 55 \u03bcU/ml, respectively, net splanchnic glucose uptake\n> was 1.0 mg/kg per min. **The rate of glucose uptake did not change\n> appreciably when the arterial insulin level was raised further to 191\n> \u03bcU/ml.**\n\n[Here][9] you can see that, as a natural response, insulin levels can reach **276 \u03bcU/ml** 1 hour after glucose administration.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nTheoretically, it seems that the optimal recovery (glycogen replenishment) after exhaustion could be achieved by injections of a mixture of glucose + fructose, at the rate 0.6 g per kg body weight, starting immediately after exercise and repeated every 30 minutes for 4 hours. Full glycogen replenishment in a 70 kg person might require 700 g of the mentioned carbohydrates per day. Some transient hyperglycemia could occur this way, but this would be likely without symptoms. [70% glucose (dextrose)][10] solutions are available.\n\nIntravenous insulin might not stimulate glycogen synthesis significantly more than naturally secreted insulin. Intravenous insulin injections would also require constant measurements of blood glucose levels to avoid hypoglycemia.\n\n\n  [1]: https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/112808/can-glucose-and-insulin-exist-in-the-same-container-without-reacting\n  [2]: http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/21/4/255\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019055/\n  [4]: https://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/110413p18.shtml\n  [5]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18340414_Liver_and_Muscle_Glycogen_in_Man_after_Glucose_and_Fructose_Infusion\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21407126\n  [7]: http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/6/1263\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329884/pdf/jcinvest00487-0172.pdf\n  [9]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2089224-overview\n  [10]: https://www.mydr.com.au/medicines/cmis/glucose-intravenous-infusion-bp-10-to-70", "18699": "During the First World War many German soldiers on the Western Front suffered from  dysentry. The physician [Alfred Nissle][1] compared sick and healthy soldiers and figured that the intestinal bacteria were significantly different. Reasoning that perhaps the bacteria from the healthy soldiers might contribute to healing the sick, he isolated a strain called [Escherichia coli Nissle 1917][2].\n\n[U Sonnenborn: \"Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917-from bench to bedside and back: history of a special Escherichia coli strain with probiotic properties.\", FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2016 Oct;363(19). pii: fnw212.

But I'd say that the doctors at the time were mostly entrenched in a line of thought from Semmelweis to Koch and Pasteur, namely that bacteria \"are evil\", and therefore the very idea of using them as therapy as a form of heresy. The exact effects, and whether they are beneficial or what, are still under debate today. ([Example from 1992][9]).

I thought I'd clarify the point about  donor/recipient compatibility. \n\n## What makes an organ compatible?\nThere are a number different things that make a donor organ work more or less well for a recipient, but each kind of organ has its own challenges. For example, where size matching is not an issue for liver transplants, it is important for heart transplants, and may be a little important for kidney transplants (Schwartz Principles of Surgery, Ch. 11)*.  For all solid organ transplants, though, the *major* driver of organ and tissue compatibility is found in 6 genes on the short arm of chromosome 6.\n\n## Antigens distinguish self from non-self\nAll jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system and are able to tell the difference between invaders (non-self) and things that are a part of their own body (self). This system works by examining patterns in biological molecules (proteins, sugars, lipids). Those patterns are called antigens. When you transplant an organ from a donor to a recipient, the recipient's immune system will look at the antigens, or patterns, on the cells of the donor organ, and make a decision about whether those cells are part of their body or part of an invader.\n\n## Identifying and responding to antigens involves the entire immune system\n\nThe way the immune system examines and responds to those antigens involves a whole series of important and complicated interactions between many different soluble proteins, receptors, and cells, including antibodies, T-cell receptors, cytokines, macrophages, and more, but the key to predicting which organs will work well is looking at the antigens themselves. \n\n\n## HLAs determine whether a recipient will recognize a donor organ as self or non-self\n\nThe most important antigens for figuring out whether a human donor organ will be compatible with a human recipient are called Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), because they are molecular patterns (antigens) initially discovered on human white blood cells (leukocytes). These antigens are very important functional proteins that play a particular role in the way the immune system works, but for our purposes you can just think of them as being little markers on each cell saying either *\"I'm one of you!\"*, or *\"I'm not one of you!\"*.  \n\nThese markers (human leukocyte antigens) are encoded in the genome. Their genes are found on the short arm of chromosome 6. These genes are part of a group of genes called the Major Histocompatibility Complex (or MHC), because they are a **major** part of determining whether a donor **tissue (histo)** will be **compatible** with a recipient's immune system. \n\n## What kind of a match do you need?\n\nThere are many many many different types of MHC alleles. Because HLAs strongly influence our ability to respond to infection, this variability is a good thing overall, but it makes transplant immunology complicated. Because there are so many different MHC alleles, finding a match can be difficult. Organs are in short supply, though, so rather than waiting for an exact match, the goal is often to [find a match that is good enough](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141243/).\n\n## Further Reading\nIn addition to the linked articles and the surgical considerations discussed in Schwartz, much of the relevant immunology here is discussed in good detail in the Transplant Immunology subsection of Chapter 11. I also recommend Lauren Sompayrac's little book, How the Immune System Works for either an introduction or review.\n\n## Note\n*Even the mechanisms of immune rejection vary from organ type to organ type. Liver transplants, for example, are not as susceptible to the kind of rejection that is caused by pre-formed antibodies. They are more susceptible to the kind caused by T-cells (again, Schwartz Ch. 11, unless [you want to see how this is even more complicated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4607901/))", "18437": "What is anodized aluminum?\n-----\n> Anodizing is an electrolytic passivation process used to increase the\n> thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal parts.\n> - [Wikipedia][1]\n\nSo, it's a layer of aluminum oxide.

Is cancer heritable?\n2. Is cancer (or cancer risk) contagious?\n\n### tl;dr\n1. Most cancer cases are not heritable. Some are. Heritable cases have particular characteristics (early onset, more than one close relative, often with cancer at multiple sites).\n2. Cancer is not contagious. Some cancer risk factors are contagious.\n\n## Is cancer heritable?\n\nAs Knudson, who developed the [two-hit hypothesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC389051/), liked to say  [Cancer is a genetic disease of somatic cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12124744). This is related, but different in important ways from a genetic disease of individuals. Tumor cells are genetically distinct from non tumor cells in an individual with cancer. [Though there are hereditary forms of most cancers, the great majority of cancer cases are not hereditary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12175530)). That is to say, in most cases, the mutations that lead to the formation of the cancer are not inherited from a person's parents.  A family history of cancer becomes significant to a clinician when there is an early age at onset in two or more close relatives (See Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Ch. 7).  Often, these hereditary cancers involve multiple tumors (see the second Knudson reference above, as well as [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9616740)). Relevant to the hypothetical case here, breast cancer in a woman in her 60s would not suggest a hereditary form a cancer that would be associated with a higher risk of cancer in the son. Breast cancer in a woman 45 or younger would make a hereditary form of cancer more likely, which would be associated with a [higher risk of cancer in her son](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5809938/). There are other risk factors to be considered, though (e.g., multiple close relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, being of Ashkenazi Jewishish heritage, among others). Guidelines for testing for the involved genes are [in flux](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480128/).\n\nIn summary, in this hypothetical case, it is unlikely that the son is at higher risk of any cancer. \n\n## Is cancer or cancer risk contagious?\n\nThe general question here is complex. The specific question here can be answered relatively easily, though.\n\nHere, the specific question seems to be: in a hypothetical scenario, given a mother with breast cancer, is there a risk of sexual transmission from the mother's son to his wife. The answer here is quite clearly no. As discussed above, the potential risk for the son here is that of a hereditary cancer syndrome. That risk is minimal, but if it wasn't, hereditary cancer syndromes are not transmitted horizontally through sexual contact. \n\nThe more complicated question has two parts itself:\n\na. is cancer contagious\nb. is cancer risk contagious\n\n### Is cancer contagious?\n\nTransmission of tumor cells from one individual to another happens, but is quite rare. Though tumor cells do metastasize in an individual, when this occurs, tumor seeds must be able to evade the immune system and find an environment suitable for adhesion and replication. Tumor associated cells (non cancerous cells that regulate the microenvironment to make it favorable for growth and replication) are discussed in this 2011 [Hanahan and Weinberg paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376230).  There are similarities to infectious processes, but cancer is not measles. Tumor cells don't shed in comparable numbers, aren't adapted for immune escape in a separate host, and don't express appropriate adhesion proteins for portals of entry on a new host or readily induce tumor associated niches in a new host. The cases where person-to-person transmission of cancer via tumor cell inoculation does occur seem to demonstrate more how cancer cells are not infectious agents. \n\n* [Donor-related tumors in transplant patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12177614) occur in immunosuppressed patients, but are still rare. The low frequency of transmission seems to be due, in part, to screening. The fact that we see this at all demonstrates the significance of transmission route and immune escape.\n\n* [Maternal-fetal, and in utero twin-twin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946918/) seem to be exceedingly rare, but have occurred, again, demonstrating the existence, but poor efficiency of transmission\n\n* [Inoculation of volunteers with tumor cells](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/125/3239/158.long) in a problematic series of experiments at Sloan Kettering in the 50s, transplantation of tumor cells into patients with other cancers, resulted in growth, recurrence after excision, and death in some cases. Transplantation into healthy volunteers (yes, they did this) resulted in nodules that spontaneously regressed. This experiment has since been interpreted as evidence for immune system control of transplanted tumor system in healthy individuals, as compared to growth and progression in a receptive niche in a cancer patient.\n\n*So person-to-person transmission of cancer cells is rare, seemingly because, unlike an infectious microbe, there is not a suitable receptor for adhesion at an exposed or accessible site, a suitable environment for replication, and adaptations for immune escape by tumor cells in the original host are not effective in a new host.*\n\nAs a side note, there are contagious cancers in other species, but this doesn't seem to be particularly relevant to a question about whether cancer (or cancer risk) can be transmitted between two humans.\n\n### Is cancer risk contagious\n\n17% of cancer cases worldwide are attributable to infectious agents (see Cecil Medicine, Ch. 183), these include viruses (e.g., HPV, hepatitis B and C, HIV, Epstein-Barr, and human herpesvirus-8) and bacteria (e.g., *H. pylori*).  These are all contagious.

The brownish deposits on teeth and tongue are mostly caused by the fact that bacterial proteins are denatured when the bacterial cell membranes are destroyed by high concentrations of chlorhexidine and disulphide functions are reduced to thiol functions, which form dark-coloured complexes with the iron(III) ions of saliva.     \nOther discolourations could occur because monosaccharides dissolved in saliva, such as glucose and fructose, react with the amine functions of bacterial proteins, the so called Maillard reaction.\n\n> There is great individual variation in the degree of staining from person to person, this makes explanation more difficult as it may be caused by intrinsic factors, differences in extrinsic factors or both. No longer accepted theories of stain formation with chlorhexidine include breakdown of chlorhexidine in the oral cavity to form parachloraniline and also that chlorhexidine may reduce bacterial activity such that partly metabolised sugars were broken down and then degraded over time to produce brown-coloured compounds. Most recent debate has centred around three possible mechanisms.     \n\n> Non-enzymatic browning reactions: Berk suggested that the protein and carbohydrate in the acquired pellicle could undergo a series of condensation and polymerisation reactions leading to discolouration of the acquired pellicle. Chlorhexidine may accelerate formation of the acquired pellicle and also catalyze steps in the Maillard reaction. Observation of furfurals, intermediate products in Maillard reactions, in brown-discoloured pellicle has leant support to the theory, but the evidence is inconclusive. Moreover, these authors did not consider at all the same staining phenomenon observed with the numerous other antiseptics.       \n\n> The formation of the pigmented sulphides of iron and tin: this theory suggests that chlorhexidine denatures the acquired pellicle to expose sulphur radicals. The exposed radicals would then be able to react with the metal ions to form the metal sulphide. Warner and coworkers have shown increased levels of iron in chlorhexidine treated individuals compared with water controls, no evidence was shown for tin. They then went on to conclude that the chromophore was not a sulphide, but a sulphur containing organic compound and metal ion complex and that chlorhexidine promoted the deposition of sulphate proteins. However, somewhat anomalously although the amount of stain and iron levels were increased, the levels of sulphide were reduced. Studies in vitro have contradicted aspects of the metal sulphide/denaturation theory. For instance, dietary staining of chlorhexidine treated tooth substance and acrylic occurred in the absence of salivary pellicle. More importantly pellicle coated surfaces exposed to protein denaturants or chlorhexidine did not stain when subsequently exposed to salts of iron and tin. Staining of saliva-coated tooth and acrylic occurred only when the chlorhexidine treatment was followed by a dietary chromogen such as tea. This has to some extent been replicated in vivo, where reciprocal rinsing with chlorhexidine and iron sulphate produced no staining in volunteers who abstained from food and beverages. However, chlorhexidine or iron sulphate followed by tea rinse produced immediately the characteristic brown and black discolouration of the teeth and tongue reported for chlorhexidine and iron respectively.           \n\n> Precipitation of dietary chromogens by chlorhexidine: Plaque inhibition is dependent upon adsorption of chlorhexidine onto the tooth surface. Davies et al. suggested that locally adsorped chlorhexidine complexed with ions from the oral environment and showed this in vitro with the colour produced between chlorhexidine and food dyes. Following this observation, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that chlorhexidine and other antiseptics known to cause staining in vivo could bind dietary chromogens to surfaces to produce staining. \n\n> One objection to the dietary chromogen theory was that there is no known correlation between chromogenic staining and dietary consumption of beverages. However, tea and coffee and red wine are not the only drinks to contain chromogenic polyphenols capable of interacting with chlorhexidine or polyvalent metal ions. Thus, the fact that staining can be produced in rabbits and dogs, which do not usually imbibe human beverages, can be explained by the presence of other polyphenols within the diet which are able to interact with chlorhexidine. Nevertheless, it was of interest to note that Leonard et al. demonstrated that staining was exaggerated in beagle dogs when tea and coffee was provided in conjunction with chlorhexidine rinses.     \n                \n> Most evidence indicates that the likely cause of staining is the precipitation of anionic dietary chromogens onto adsorped cations. Thus, polyphenols found in dietary substances, being anionic, are able to react with cations adsorped to surfaces such as the cationic antiseptics or polyvalent metal ions to produce staining. The difference in the potential of various cationic antiseptics to produce staining in vivo can be explained by their differing substantivity, which is consistent with the dietary aetiology. The apparent individual variation in staining noted in particular with chlorhexidine is of interest. It is worthy of note that from the diet controlled studies this variation can not be explained solely as a difference in the quantities of chromogenic agents in any one individual's diet even though abstinence from tea, coffee or red wine virtually eliminates staining from everyone. Clearly differences do exist in the propensity of individuals to produce stain and it is worthy of further investigation as it would be relevant to the need to use cosmetic tooth whitening products. There is no evidence to show that chlorhexidine is any less effective in people with a low susceptibility to staining.         <br>  \n<sup>[A Watts & M Addy: \"Tooth discolouration and staining: a review of the literature\", British Dental Journal volume 190, pages 309\u2013316 (24 March 2001)][1]; [PDF][2], [DOI][3]</sup>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<sub>L.

This so-called *serotonin hypothesis of depression* is very simple, in that it claims that a low level of serotonin causes the major depressive disorder. The fact that some antidepressants are *selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)* seems to further support this theory.\n \n\nHowever, recent findings have shown that impairing serotonin function can cause clinical depression in some circumstances, but is neither necessary nor sufficient.  \n\n<sup>This was a brief summary of: *Cowen, Philip J., and Michael Browning. \"**[What Has Serotonin to Do with Depression?][1]**\" World Psychiatry 14, no. 2 (2015): 158-60. doi:10.1002/wps.20229.*</sup>\n\nAs a follow up, it has been suggested that elevated levels of the \"stress hormone\" cortisol lead to decreased 5-HT levels, which in turn leads to depression.

In fact, it's the most potent toxin known, and could potentially be used as a bioweapon. \n\n\n> [**Botulinum toxin: Bioweapon & magic drug (Dhaked, et al. 2010)**][1]\n\n> Botulinum neurotoxins, causative agents of botulism in humans, are produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic spore-former Gram positive bacillus. **Botulinum neurotoxin poses a major bioweapon threat because of its extreme potency and lethality; its ease of production, transport, and misuse; and the need for prolonged intensive care among affected persons. A single gram of crystalline toxin, evenly dispersed and inhaled, can kill more than one million people.** The basis of the phenomenal potency of botulinum toxin is enzymatic; the toxin is a zinc proteinase that cleaves neuronal vesicle associated proteins responsible for acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular junction. **As a military or terrorist weapon, botulinum toxin could be disseminated via aerosol or by contamination of water or food supplies, causing widespread casualties.** A fascinating aspect of botulinum toxin research in recent years has been development of the most potent toxin into a molecule of significant therapeutic utility. It is the first biological toxin which is licensed for treatment of human diseases. In the late 1980s, Canada approved use of the toxin to treat strabismus, in 2001 in the removal of facial wrinkles and in 2002, the FDA in the United States followed suit. The present review focuses on both warfare potential and medical uses of botulinum neurotoxin.\n\nHowever, if you injected, say, 40 units of botox into your procerus and corrugator supercilii frown muscles, you would get a drug with a robust antidepressant effect. The effect size is quite impressive and the antidepressant effect may be greater than what is typically seen from conventional antidepressants:\n\n> **[Treating Depression with Botulinum Toxin: A Pooled \nAnalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (Magid, et al. 2015)][2]**\n\n> Botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection into the glabellar region is currently being studied as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we explore efficacy data of this novel approach in a pooled analysis.A literature search revealed 3 RCTs on this topic. Individual patient data and clinical end points shared by these 3 trials were pooled and analyzed as one study (n=134) using multiple regression models with random effects.In the pooled sample, the BTA (n=59) and the placebo group (n=75) did not differ in the baseline variables. Efficacy outcomes revealed BTA superiority over placebo: Improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 6 weeks after baseline was 45.7% for BTA vs. 14.6% for placebo (p<0.0001), corresponding to a BTA response rate of 54.2% (vs. 10.7%) and a BTA remission rate of 30.5% (vs. 6.7%). Equalling the status of a meta-analysis, this study increases evidence that a single treatment of BTA into the glabellar region can reduce symptoms of MDD. Further studies are needed to better understand how BTA exerts its mood-lifting effect. \n\nThe proposed mechanism of action is quite interesting. It's thought that afferents in the face can influence your mood by sending feedback to the amygdala. In short, botox works by paralysing the frown muscles in your face. And if you can't frown, then perhaps you can't feel so down:\n\n> **[Emotional proprioception: Treatment of depression with afferent facial feedback<br>(Finzi & Rosenthal, 2016)][3]**\n>\n> We develop the concept of emotional proprioception, whereby the muscles of facial expression play a central role in encoding and transmitting information to the brain\u2019s emotional circuitry, and describe its underlying neuroanatomy. We explore the role of facial expression in both re\ufb02ecting and in\ufb02uencing depressed mood. The circuitry involved in this latter effect is a logical target for treatment with botulinum toxin, and we review the evidence in support of this strategy. Clinical trial data suggest that botulinum toxin is effective in treating depression. We discuss the clinical and theoretical implications of these data. This novel treatment approach is just one example of the potential importance of the cranial nerves in the treatment of depression.\n\n**References**\n\nDhaked, R. K., Singh, M.

Recent incidents have shown that improper handling of metal dusts can cost lives. Apart from this, inappropriate metal-dust handling poses health risks, property dam- age possibilities, and housekeeping/maintenance costs. The key to reducing metal-dust hazards is to first minimize dust generation whenever possible. For the dust that is generated, safe and proper containment and capture follows. The proper design of powder storage and handling systems is quintessential in this regard. For the dust that still manages to find egress from the main process and accumulate, effective housekeeping and maintenance becomes the next line of protection. Also, it is important to perform site assessments for dust-hazard potentials and implement strategies to minimize the risks.\n> <sub>[Understanding and Preventing Metal Dust Hazards - Jenike & Johanson][3]</sub>\n\n\nAll of these findings and resulting recommendations are for occupational hazards and risks.

HIV is a virus that once it is in your body and you have antibodies developed will have caused an STI, which once it progresses to the symptoms of AIDS, becomes an STD that nobody wants.\n\nSo it is mainly a historically formed cultural response to single out HIV. And a result of attention marketing.\n\nHIV spread very rapidly in the West from the late 70s onwards, it was seen as an incurable deadly disease \u2013 that was new, and initially not even widely recognised as an STD, but sometimes as God's revenge, a form of cancer etc. \u2013that just takes long enough to kill everyone infected to enable all those promiscuous sinners to infect a large number of people.    \n<sub>([Jaques Pepin: \"The Origins of AIDS\", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, New York, 2011,][1] ch 13 Globalisation.)</sub>\n\nAt the time of identification the public mind just had a lot of sex from the sexual revolution and saw other STDs as a souvenir from being very active, to be worn in pride since antibiotics could cure the most prominent bacterial infections with unprecedented effectiveness. This carefree and wrong attitude towards many STDs is still somewhat prevalent.     \n\n> The advent of the gay liberation movement in the late 1960s and 1970s led to the creation of a more self-confident \u2018out\u2019 gay community with a number of activist and campaigning groups. Sexual liberation became an important component of gay life; many sexually active gay men came to regard attendance at STD clinics as a regular, if inconvenient, aspect of sexual life.     \nBy the mid-1960s, the number of attendances at STD clinics was increasing dramatically. The \u2018sexual revolution\u2019 of the \u2018permissive society\u2019, the advent of the oral contraceptive pill and the declining popularity of the condom all contributed to an increase of STDs, particularly viral infections. The increased incidence of STDs was seen in official circles as \u2018primarily a reflection of sexual promiscuity in the population\u2019; rather than prostitutes, however, the main social groups now seen to be responsible were teenagers, immigrants, asymptomatic promiscuous women and homosexuals.    \n<sub>([Roger Davidson and Lesley A. Hall (Eds.)][2]: \"Sex, Sin and Suffering.\nVenereal disease and European society since 1870\", Routledge: London, New York, 2001, p 246\u2013247.)</sub>\n\n\n\nIn the case of HIV/AIDS these social background factors of scientific medicine still linger on:\n> Scientific discoveries such as the discovery of a new disease exert a fascination not only on the scientific community and the lay public, but also on social scientists. For the first, discovery is the main drive and the ultimate goal. For the lay public, it is often accompanied by the promise of curing illnesses and improving people\u2019s lives. For social scientists, scientific discoveries are the domain where the role, influence, and limitations of social factors \u2013 such as interests, resources, and relationships \u2013 can be perhaps best examined.    \nThat such factors play a role in discovery making has not been contested; the question is whether scientific discoveries are evaluated, acknowledged, and accepted by the scientific community according to universal standards of rationality or according to the resources, influence, and social relationships of the scientists themselves. The positivist tradition has solved this problem by distinguishing between the context of discovery and the context of justification. Whereas the former is messy (involving serendipity, accident, resources, interests, and the like), the latter is determined by rigorous criteria of universal applicability.    \nThis distinction has been contested by sociologists and historians of science alike who argue that, in practice, the two contexts are indistinguishable: justification takes place in the process of discovery itself (e.g., Nickles 1992, p. 89; Hacking 1996, p. 51). Consequently, justification is not exclusively determined by logical criteria; factors such as interests, resources, and networks of relationships play a considerable role (Stump 1996, p. 445). \n\n> <sub>[Alex Preda: \"AIDS, Rhetoric, and Medical Knowledge\", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, New York, 2005][3], p47.  </sub>\n\n\"Getting AIDS\" is still seen by the larger public as the most dangerous of all STDs, with most others either classified as manageable or less important in their consequences. Whether true or not is irrelevant in the public's mind, and even these attitudes seem in decline and attention is unhealthily highly put on AIDS/HIV treatment advances, \"normal lives\", and now even the possibilities of vaccinations getting closer.\n\nIf this reason for keeping HIV singled out when talking about STI/STDs is historical, why keep it separate?   \n\nOn the one hand, there is this connection between other STDs and HIV/AIDS, mentioned in other answers: having one increases to chance of catching the other.  But it is also theorised that from a public health standpoint awareness and acceptance of preventive measures, testing and treatments might be improved simultaneously \u2013 not to mention the all important funding of research, prevention programs \u2013 the hypothesis of \"epidemiological synergy ([Wasserheit 1992][4]; [Fleming and Wasserheit 1999][5]).\"\n\n> \n<sub>Charles Klein & Delia Easton: \"Structural Barriers and Facilitators in HIV Prevention: A Review of International Research\"; Sevgi O. Aral & Thomas A. Peterman: \"STD Diagnosis and Treatment as an HIV Prevention Strategy\"; in: [Ann O\u2019Leary (Ed.): \"Beyond Condoms. Alternative Approaches to HIV Prevention\", Kluwer Academic Publishers: New York, Boston, 2002][6].)</sub>     \nSTD control for HIV prevention is a controversial interface between well-financed HIV prevention programs and less wealthy STD prevention programs. STD experts are frustrated at the lack of HIV and other resources committed to this HIV prevention strategy. Some HIV experts are skeptical of the motivations of the proponents of this strategy, and think the potential for HIV prevention by STD control has been exaggerated. Between these two camps lies a huge mass of data accumulated by hundreds of studies conducted over the past 15 years. Synthesizing this data is particularly important for HIV prevention world wide, because the developing countries where STD control programs have been weak are often the countries where the AIDS epidemic has been most devastating.\nWhile epidemiological and microbiological evidence support the existence of a two-way relationship between STDs and HIV infection, the relationship between early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment of STDs and prevention of spread of HIV needs to be further elaborated. The parameters that need to be specified in such elaboration include 1) factors related to the STI: the specific STI; whether the STI is symptomatic or asymptomatic; whether the STI is incident (new) infection or prevalent (chronic or long standing) infection; and perhaps the stage of the sexually transmitted infection; 2) factors related to the population, which may also function as multipliers of the STI effect: age-gender composition; patterns of sexual mixing and concurrency; prevalence of male circumcision; 3) factors related to the phases of the STD and HIV epidemics: for example, whether the HIV and STD epidemics are nascent or generalized epidemics; 4) factors related to the goals of the HIV prevention program: objectives related topreventing the acquisition of infection among the uninfected; objectives related to preventing the transmission of infection by the infected; objectives related to provision of services to protect the personal health of individual members of the population; objectives related to protecting public health, i.e., limiting the spread of HIV infections: objectives related to targeting primary prevention of HIV through behavior change versus primary prevention of HIV through control of co-factors. The appropriate approach to the implementation of STD control for HIV prevention in a specific setting depends on the values of all of the above factors. In addition, many of the above factors are interdependent, and it is important to consider their reciprocal influences.\n\nIt seems quite useful from an epidemiological view to just not neglect one of the two closely interconnected halves of this problem realm. And previously, after the advent of penicillin, the public mind and imaginations (including those of politicians) did start to neglect other STDs as long as the discussion went for funding, morals and opinions were always cheap. \n\n\n>From this perspective, rhetorical practices are not an obstacle but rather a necessary ingredient of expert democracy. Bridging the gap between science and the general public has become crucial to the public sphere and democracy. This means we must acknowledge that rhetorical practices do matter and act accordingly.   \n<sub>Preda (2005): \"How Rhetorical Practices Matter for AIDS Prevention\", p229ff.</sub>\n\n\n---\n\nTo sum this position up: HIV/AIDS was seen as something different from what was known as STI/STDs even by medical professionals, it is still seen as \"different\" in the public eye. Apart from being \"on of the most [\"popular\" STIs][7] it is also seen as the deadliest. Apart from the historical reasons that lead to it being listed separately, this separation is continued for science communication reasons. It is thought to help with awareness, prevention, testing and treatment. In really short terms: sticklers, like me,  point out quite rightly that HIV/AIDS is an STI/STD. But the usual presentation now is both historically grown *and* useful. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-origins-of-aids/2BDB50F42C4E17103286A3043647AA4D\n  [2]: http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/248\n  [3]: http://www.cambridge.org/core_title/gb/245053\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1595015\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10448335\n  [6]: https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780306467318\n  [7]: http://www.enjoyliving.at/lieben-und-leben-magazin/lust-und-liebe/sexualitaet/haeufige-geschlechtskrankheiten-ein-ueberblick.html", "16362": "To directly answer your question: it is not.  \"Natural\" sugar is no healthier than \"refined\" sugar, and sugar in fruits is no healthier than sugar in juice.  Sugar molecules are sugar molecules, regardless of whether they are \"natural\" or \"refined.\"  There is no difference.  \n\nHowever, I believe the real question here is why the WHO is recommending one type of food over another, so I'll attempt to address this.  \n\nThe sugar is the same, but (1) the rest of the food that you eat with the sugar is different, so (2) your overall diet is different, (3) which leads to different health effects.  \n\n(1) When you eat refined sugar you are typically not consuming nutrient-dense foods.  A simple example is oranges vs. orange juice.  Have you ever tried to eat three oranges?  It's not easy.  You have to chew a lot of pulp, which fills you up, and later on you may have bowel issues due to the large amount of fiber.  These are natural mechanisms that help to prevent you from over-consuming oranges.  However, if you instead squeeze these oranges, you get a glass of orange juice, which is easy to drink, and due to the lack of pulp it is easy to digest and does not fill you up.  \n\n(2) A healthy diet has carbs, protein, fats, fiber, water, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, and if you eat a balanced mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, grains, nuts, and/or other \"natural\" foods, you can get a pretty good mix of these.  If you consume a large quantity of refined foods, you'll get a lot of sugar, salt, and fat, but not much else, so you get a lot of calories but don't make much progress in your overall nutrient needs.  This has the dual effects of excess calories and nutrient deficiency.  You're starving (for nutrients) and over-consuming (sugar, salt, and fat) at the same time.  \n\n(3) This unbalanced diet (heavy in sugar) leads to some health effects such as (a) excess weight gain, and (b) decreased insulin sensitivity.  \n\n(3a) Fructose is generally processed by the liver, and it does not trigger the \"fullness\" feeling like glucose and other foods, leading to excess calorie consumption and weight gain.  This extra body fat is associated with negative health effects. \n\n(3b) Insulin helps regulate blood sugar, but it can lose effectiveness, especially when blood sugar quickly and repeatedly rises to high levels.  This is not just due to sugar, but starch and high glycemic index foods that easily break down into glucose.  The amount matters, too.  It's not just how fast the food gets converted to glucose but how much of it there is.  \n\nTable sugar (sucrose) and corn syrup (including high fructose corn syrup) have both glucose and fructose, so you'll probably see both effects if you include enough refined foods in your diet.  \n\nSo, bottom line: refined foods have the same sugar chemicals, but the overall composition of the foods is skewed away from nutrients and toward sugar, which means the overall diet is out of balance, leading to over-consumption of calories, weight gain, and insulin resistance, which are associated with a number of health problems.\n\nReferences:<BR>\n[1] Maria Gadoy, \"What's More Nutritious, Orange Juice Or An Orange?

When looking at this paper I see a good lab with competence and expertise in the area performing a test on a small number of mice, where they give standard lab chow and lab chow containing significant amount of canola oil. The effects seen cannot be directly attributed to canola oil per se, but to oil consumption, or increased calories in the diet, or just being overweight. Obesity is associated with at least certain forms of AD, so seeing specific markers and mild impairment in an AD mouse model is probably not surprising.\n\n\nIt may very well turn out that unidentified or untested for toxins, pollutants, pesticides, mineral oil residues or who knows what in the oil tested elicits undesirable effects. Erucic acid is perhaps not the only poison naturally found in rapeseed that makes it less than ideal as 'the standard cooking oil'. That paper in question doesn't tell and does not allow to infer any such conclusion either way. It may be an important clue, an honest error or just junk.\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the positive evidence in favour of using rapeseed oil seems to have the majority:   \n[Lin Lin et al.: \"Evidence of health benefits of canola oil\", Nutrition Reviews, Volume71, Issue6, June 2013, p 370-385][4], [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1111/nure.12033):\n> Canola oil\u2010based diets have been shown to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in comparison with diets containing higher levels of saturated fatty acids. Consumption of canola oil also influences biological functions that affect various other biomarkers of disease risk. Previous reviews have focused on the health effects of individual components of canola oil. Here, the objective is to address the health effects of intact canola oil, as this has immediate practical implications for consumers, nutritionists, and others deciding which oil to consume or recommend. A literature search was conducted to examine the effects of canola oil consumption on coronary heart disease, insulin sensitivity, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, energy metabolism, and cancer cell growth. Data reveal substantial reductions in total cholesterol and low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as other positive actions, including increased tocopherol levels and improved insulin sensitivity, compared with consumption of other dietary fat sources.

That is unfounded. The liver is usually quite resilient and capable of taking quite a lot of abuse.\n\nBut consumption of alcohol is not without dangers. Also not for a single incident. Of course it depends. The question does not indicate \"how much\" alcohol would be involved in that hypothetical incidence. \"One/Once too many\" can easily kill a human. That does not necessarily include involvement of acute hepatoxicity, although it mainly is common knowledge for acute overdose.\n\nDepending on individual genetics, nutritional status, fitness level, other health parameters, a single sufficiently large dose of alcohol can really damage a liver. Adding some drugs \u2013 like [paracetamol][1] \u2013 into the mix and the liver gets even more vulnerable.\n\nSome overview might be found in [Definition, epidemiology and magnitude of alcoholic hepatitis][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014937/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124876/", "15097": "While the blood pregnancy test is one option, urine pregnancy tests are still possible in an unconscious patient via a Foley catheter, which is a tube inserted up the urethra into the bladder. These catheters are commonly placed in trauma patients (2).\n\nThere are several things that can be done during emergency management of a patient that can potentially cause harm to a fetus. One of these is imaging involving radiation, such as X-rays or CT scans. However, after 16 weeks of pregnancy imaging is unlikely to cause harm to a fetus (1). There are a number of drugs that can cause harm to a fetus (teratogenic drugs), however many safe alternatives exist, and emergency medical personnel are trained to treat you as though you are pregnant until proven otherwise (3,4)\n\nReferences:\n\n[Effects of Radiation on Fetus][1]\n\n[Indications for a Foley Catheter][2]\n\n[Teratogenic Medications in Pregnancy][3]\n\n[Management of a Potentially Pregnant Trauma Patient][4]\n\n\n  [1]: https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/prenatalphysician.asp\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889669/\n  [3]: https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/meds/index.html\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26334607/", "15047": "The common saying that alcohol (ethyl alcohol in alcoholic beverages) and benzodiazepines shouldn't be consumed together is well-recommended considering that both compounds fall under the Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressant category. So they both augment (additive) the effect of depressing the CNS, which can lead to unconsciousness or even a coma. Also, both substances can be abused, which can lead to increasing (again, additive effect) damages in health (liver,kidney,mental state) and relationships. \n\nIn regards to your question of the synergistic/multiplicative effect, there have been pharmacological studies (See References for more information) studying the interactions between alcohol and psychiatric drugs (including benzodiazepines).

The reverse effect can be seen for a chronic alcohol consumer. \n\nA hint of the more detailed biochemical explanation: \"Highly bound drugs with low intrinsic hepatic clearance are among those most commonly reported to have their kinetics altered by ethanol (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenytoin, tolbutamide and warfarin).\" \n\nOverall, great question!\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTLDR: \n\nMultiplicative: Yes (depends) \n\nAdditive: Yes\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences:\n\nToxicology Paper on Drug Interactions: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2710.2003.00459.x/full\n\nQuick Explanation of how Alcohol Effects Body:\nhttp://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/i/i_03/i_03_m/i_03_m_par/i_03_m_par_alcool.html\n\nQuick Overview on CNS Depressants:\nhttp://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/central-nervous-system-depressants/\n\nIn-depth Explanation on how Benzodiazepines Effect the Body:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684331/", "14769": "Premature ejaculation has variable definitions, which cause some difficulties in diagnosis. The main [treatment methods][1] are psychological counseling, behavioral therapy, drug therapy and surgical treatment.\n>Drug therapy including topical drugs, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRi), receptor blockers, type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5i), etc., of the latest medications can choose hydrochloric acid of dapoxetine (Priligy) treatment.\n\nThe [oxytocin antagonists][2] shows good results, but they demands further reserches.\n>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone that is believed to shorten ejaculatory latency times through central and peripheral pathways in animal models. The ejaculatory delay observed with SSRIs may be mediated by alterations in the central release of oxytocin. This has formed the basis of the development of oxytocin receptor antagonists. The first drug used in human clinical trials was epelsiban. This is a highly selective oxytocin receptor antagonist with rapid absorption and elimination. It had been shown to delay ejaculatory latency in animal models. In this multicentre study, men were randomly assigned to placebo or epelsiban (50 mg/150 mg). Study inclusion was based on the ISSM definition of PE, and IELT was measured with the use of a stopwatch. There was no significant difference in the baseline IELT measurements between the groups. Following 8 weeks of treatment, there were no significant clinical or statistically significant differences in IELT between the groups. The authors speculated that efficacy may be linked to centrally acting oxytocin antagonist activity. There is some evidence from animal studies to support this hypothesis. This has led to the development of the most recent oxytocin antagonist. This is a small molecule with good central penetration and rapid absorption with potent antagonism of the oxytocin receptor. A total of 88 men with LPE were randomly assigned to either placebo or active drug (400 mg/800 mg). Inclusion appeared to be based on ISSM criteria. Following 8 weeks of treatment, IX-01 resulted in a 3-fold increase in IELT (1.6 in the placebo group). This improvement was observed as early as 2 weeks after starting treatment. The drug was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events; 21% reported at least one adverse event (30% in the placebo group). The dropout rate was high: 21% with the active drug and 27% in the placebo arm. This is obviously encouraging news for the field, and we should expect larger trials involving a more diverse population.\n\nThe combination of [drug and behavioural therapy][3] shows more effective results.\n>MATERIALS AND METHODS:\n18 patients were enrolled, aged between 25 and 55 (mean: 40), all with primary PE, free of comorbidities and with their partners involved. Six patients were prescribed 30 mg dapoxetine two hours before sexual relations for 3 months (group A); 6 patients began the dynamic rehabilitative treatment (group B); 6 other couples were assigned to pharmacological treatment in association with dynamic rehabilitative behavioural treatment for 3 months (group C). Division of subjects was carried out by simple randomisation, excluding patients with a short frenulum, phimosis, ED, chronic prostatitis or experiencing results from previous treatment.\n\n>RESULTS:\nOutcomes of treatment were evaluated at the end of the 3 months of treatment and 3 months after discontinuing treatment. In Group A 75% of patients were cured at 3 months and 25% at 6 months. In Group B 25% patients were cured at 3 months and 25% at 6 months. In Group C 75% of patients were cured 3 months and 50% at 6 months. \"Cured\" means a Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) score reduced from an average of 12 to an average of 6 and Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time (IELT) values from &lt; 1 to &gt; 6 minutes.\n\nSometimes keeping to healthy lifestile can prevent medical treatment.

Some compounds (like the [poyphenols][1]) have shown some activity against harmful bacteria causing gingivitis or caries.\n\nThe most significant part plays the sometimes enormous amount of fluoride tea contains. Fluoride hardens the enamel against acids from bacteria metabolising around. In fact tea has often [so much fluoride that this is much more likely to be a health concern][2] than the caffeine content some hysterics worry about. ([Or not?][3] Since everyone should only buy tea that was tested for pesticides,  radioactivity, and other contaminations, why not demand a chemical analysis sheet as well?)\n\n1. Green tea is tooth friendly. It does not cause or aggravate tooth decay. On the contrary, it usually makes your teeth stronger (and stains them, alas) \u2013 Green tea will not stop or reverse caries.\n\n2. Every sugar drink replaced by tea helps. How much tea is needed for the effects of fluoride to be significant depends on other dietary factors, water fluoridation and tooth paste used. The amount of tea is therefore impossible to gauge exactly but an upper limit is dependent on how much tea a user can take (if the fluoride content is kept well below a dosage causing problems like fluorosis) since caffeine and tannins are not equally well tolerated by everyone.\n\n3.

A substance of <10kDa in mass in Assam tea had a high concentration of galloylated catechins and a stronger biofilm inhibiting activity than green tea. In contrast, substances >10kDa in mass from green tea included higher concentrations of polysaccharides composed of galacturonic acid, such as pectin, that enhance biofilm formation.<br>\n**Conclusions:**\nThe higher concentrations of galloylated catechins in Assam tea may assist in prevention of dental caries, whereas in green tea, this mode of inhibition was likely offset by the presence of pectin.

However, it must be emphasized that tooth decay (dental caries) is not caused by fluoride deficiency and fluoride supplementation will never reverse the active or gross carious lesions. Since the level of safety of fluoride is low, products that contain a high level of fluoride should be stored and used according to the recommend-dation and should be monitored by a qualified dental professional especially in children and pregnant women. In children, the swallowing reflex is not very well developed and the fluoride containing dental products are flavored hence increasing the possibility of a child to consume an excessive dose of fluoride.

Short summary, the new 2015 US PHS standard (0.7 mg/L) or even the old one (0.7-1.2 mg/L) are below the doses at which negative effects were observed in China (2.5-4.1 mg/L), and the evidence from there is not of high quality, even though there's one meta-analysis of it. (As a cautionary tale on inferring from low quality evidence, [the first meta-analysis of homeopathy found positive results](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/20353/29579), latter ones which filtered out low-quality studies were more skeptical.)\n\nBut back to fluoride, what did the United States Public Health Service (PHS), actually [decide in 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547570/)?\n\n> For these community water systems that add fluoride, PHS now recommends an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams/liter (mg/L). In this guidance, the optimal concentration of fluoride in drinking water is the concentration that provides the best balance of protection from dental caries while limiting the risk of dental fluorosis. The earlier PHS recommendation for fluoride concentrations was based on outdoor air temperature of geographic areas and ranged from 0.7\u20131.2 mg/L. \n\nAs for neurotoxicity, this was PHS's review of the new evidence:\n\n> IQ and other neurological effects.\nThe standard letters and approximately 100 unique responses expressed concern about fluoride's impact on the brain, specifically citing lower IQ in children. Several Chinese studies considered in detail by the NRC review reported lower IQ among children exposed to fluoride in drinking water at mean concentrations of 2.5\u20134.1 mg/L\u2014several times higher than concentrations recommended for community water fluoridation.[81\u201383] The NRC found that \u201cthe significance of these Chinese studies is uncertain\u201d because important procedural details were omitted, but also stated that findings warranted additional research on the effects of fluoride on intelligence.[6]\n\n> Based on animal studies, the NRC committee speculated about potential mechanisms for nervous system changes and called for more research \u201cto clarify the effect of fluoride on brain chemistry and function.\u201d These recommendations should be considered in the context of the NRC review, which limited its conclusions regarding adverse effects to water fluoride concentrations of 2\u20134 mg/L and did \u201cnot address the lower exposures commonly experienced by most U.S. citizens.\u201d[6] A recent meta-analysis of studies conducted in rural China, including those considered by the NRC report, identified an association between high fluoride exposure (i.e., drinking water concentrations ranging up to 11.5 mg/L) and lower IQ scores; study authors noted the low quality of included studies and the inability to rule out other explanations.[84] A subsequent review cited this meta-analysis to support its identification of \u201craised fluoride concentrations\u201d in drinking water as a developmental neurotoxicant.[85]\n\n> A review by SCHER also considered the neurotoxicity of fluoride in water and determined that there was not enough evidence from well-controlled studies to conclude if fluoride in drinking water at concentrations used for community fluoridation might impair the IQ of children. The review also noted that \u201ca biological plausibility for the link between fluoridated water and IQ has not been established.\u201d[79] Findings of a recent prospective study of a birth cohort in New Zealand did not support an association between fluoride exposure, including residence in an area with fluoridated water during early childhood, and IQ measured repeatedly during childhood and at age 38 years.[86]\n\nFrom the actual [New Zealand study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265943/) we find out they used a simiar standard as the US, albeit slighly lower at 0.7-1 mg/L, and no effect on IQ was noticeable at this level of exposure.\n\nAnd the stated reason for lowering the PHS standard in 2015 to just 0.7mg/L was based on risk of fluorosis\n\n> Although not fully generalizable to the current U.S. context, these findings, along with findings from the 1986\u20131987 survey of U.S. schoolchildren, suggest that the risk of fluorosis can be reduced and caries prevention maintained toward the lower end (i.e., 0.7 mg/L) of the 1962 PHS recommendations for community water fluoridation.\n\nand lack of need for the higher value (1.2 mg/L)\n\n> Recent data do not show a convincing relationship between water intake and outdoor air temperature. Thus, recommendations for water fluoride concentrations that differ based on outdoor temperature are unnecessary.\n\n", "14404": "There has been an ongoing debate regarding health risks from the electromagnetic fields being emitted from WiFi routers. The constant radiation exposure is arguably dangerous at close distances and may contribute to serious health issues, especially with long-term \u201cchronic\u201d exposure.\n\nIn 2011, the World Health Organization classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as \u201c[possibly carcinogenic to humans](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/index.php)\u201d based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer, associated with wireless phone use. \n\nThe potential for adverse health effects resulting from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, such as those emitted by wireless communication devices, are detailed in a 2011 World Health Organization press release titled, '[IARC Classifies Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans](https://www.scribd.com/document/56730830/pr208-E)'.\n\n> From May 24-31 2011, a Working Group of 31 scientists from 14 countries has been meeting at IARC in Lyon, France to assess the potential carcinogenic hazards from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. These assessments will be published as Volume 102 of the IARC Monographs, which will be the fifth volume in this series to focus on physical agents, after Volume 55 (Solar Radiation), Volume 75 and Volume 78 on ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma-rays, neutrons, radio-nuclides), and [Volume 80](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol80/mono80.pdf) on non-ionizing radiation (extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields). \n\nThe IARC Monograph Working Group discussed the possibility that these exposures\ncould induce long-term effects, in particular an increased risk for cancer. The\nexposure categories involving radiofrequency electromagnetic fields that were discussed and evaluated included:\n\n> \u2026occupational exposures to radar and microwaves; environmental exposures associated with transmission of signals for radio, television and wireless telecommunication; and personal exposures associated with the use of wireless telephones.\n\nInternational experts shared the complex task of tackling the [exposure data](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/currentb1exp0706.php), [the studies of cancer in humans](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/currentb2studieshumans0706.php), [the studies of cancer in experimental animals](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/currentb3studiesanimals0706.php), and the [mechanistic and other relevant data](http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/currentb4studiesother0706.php).\n\n> **Results**\n\n> The evidence was reviewed critically, and overall evaluated as being limited* among users of wireless telephones for glioma and acoustic neuroma, and inadequate** to draw conclusions for other types of cancers. The evidence from the occupational and environmental exposures mentioned above was similarly judged inadequate. The Working Group did not quantitate the risk; however, **one study of past cell phone use (up to the year 2004), showed a 40% increased risk for gliomas in the highest category of heavy users (reported average: 30 minutes per day over a 10\u2010year period)**\n>> *'Limited evidence of carcinogenicity': A positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered by the Working Group to be credible, but chance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.\n\n>> **'Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity': The available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency or statistical power to permit a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a causal association between exposure and cancer, or no data on cancer in humans are available. \n\nDr. Jonathan Same (University of Southern California, USA) and overall Chairman of the Working Group, suggested that\n\n> \u201c\u2026the evidence, while still accumulating, is strong enough to support a conclusion... The conclusion means that **there could be some risk**, and therefore we need to keep a close watch for a link between cell phones and cancer risk.\u201d\n\nThe IARC Director, Christopher Wild added,\n\n> \u201dGiven the potential consequences for public health of this classification and findings, it is important that additional research be conducted into the long term, heavy use of mobile phones. Pending the availability of such information, **it is important to take pragmatic measures to reduce exposure such as hands-free devices or texting**\u201d\n\nSeveral scientific articles resulting from the [Interphone study](http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2010/pdfs/pr200_E.pdf) were made available to the working group and were included in the evaluation. \n\nOne of the scientific articles, \u2019[Acoustic neuroma risk in relation to mobile telephone use: results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862434)\u2019 determined that\n\n> **There was no increase in risk of acoustic neuroma with ever regular use of a mobile phone or for users who began regular use 10 years or more before the reference date.** Elevated odds ratios observed at the highest level of cumulative call time could be due to chance, reporting bias or a causal effect. As acoustic neuroma is usually a slowly growing tumour, the interval between introduction of mobile phones and occurrence of the tumour might have been too short to observe an effect, if there is one.\n\nA second scientific article also included in the evaluation, \u2018[Estimation of RF energy absorbed in the brain from mobile phones in the Interphone Study](http://oem.bmj.com/content/68/9/686),\u2019 explained\n\n> While amount and duration of use are important determinants of RF dose in the brain, their **impact can be substantially modified by communication system, frequency band and location in the brain**. It is important to take these into account in analyses of risk of brain tumors from RF exposure from mobile phones.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a guide on [Wireless Devices and Health Concerns](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns) addresses the topic of RF exposure. \n\n> ...the Federal Communications Commission, federal health and safety agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have been actively involved in monitoring and investigating issues related to RF exposure. For example, the FDA has issued guidelines for safe RF emission levels from microwave ovens, and it continues to monitor exposure issues related to the use of certain RF devices such as cellular telephones. NIOSH conducts investigations and health hazard assessments related to occupational RF exposure.\n\n> Federal, state and local government agencies and other organizations have generally relied on RF exposure standards developed by expert non-government organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). \n\n> Since 1996, the FCC has required that **all wireless communications devices sold in the United States meet its minimum guidelines for safe human exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy**. \n\nThe FCC\u2019s guidelines and rules regarding RF exposure \n\n>...are based upon standards developed by IEEE and NCRP and input from other federal agencies... \n\nThese guidelines specify exposure limits for hand-held wireless devices determined by the **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)**. \n\n>The SAR is a measure of the rate that RF energy is absorbed by the body. **For exposure to RF energy from wireless devices, the allowable FCC SAR limit is 1.6 watts per kilogram (W/kg), as averaged over one gram of tissue**.\n\nAs of 1996, the FCC has required that\n\n> ...**all wireless devices sold in the US go through a formal FCC approval process to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum allowable SAR level when operating at the device\u2019s highest possible power level.**\n\nSeveral US government agencies and international organizations work cooperatively to monitor research on the health effects of RF exposure.\n\n> According to the FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO), among other organizations, to date, **the weight of scientific evidence has not effectively linked exposure to radio frequency energy from mobile devices with any known health problems**.\n\nSome health and safety interest groups have interpreted certain reports to suggest that wireless device use may be linked to cancer and other illnesses, posing potentially greater risks for children than adults. \n\n> While these assertions have gained increased public attention, currently **no scientific evidence establishes a causal link between wireless device use and cancer or other illnesses**. \n\nAlthough no scientific evidence currently establishes a direct link between wireless device use and cancer (or other illnesses), some consumers are skeptical of the science and analysis that underlies the FCC\u2019s RF exposure guidelines. Thus, some parties recommend taking precautionary measures to further reduce exposure to RF energy.\u00a0\n\nThe FCC does not endorse the need for these practices, but provides information on steps you can take to reduce your exposure to RF energy from cell phones.\u00a0For example,\n\n> ...**wireless devices only emit RF energy when you are using them and, the closer the device is to you, the more energy you will absorb**.\n\nSome of the FCC's suggested measures to reduce RF exposure include the following:\n\n> <ul><li>Use a speakerphone, earpiece or headset to reduce proximity to the head (and thus exposure). While wired earpieces may conduct some energy to the head and wireless earpieces also emit a small amount of RF energy, both wired and wireless earpieces remove the greatest source of RF energy (the cell phone) from proximity to the head and thus can greatly reduce total exposure to the head.</li><li><b>Increase the distance between wireless devices and your body.</b></li><li>Consider texting rather than talking -\u00a0but don\u2019t text while you are driving.</li></ul>\n\nAlthough potentially misleading, some parties recommend considering reported SAR values of wireless devices.\n\n> First, the actual **SAR varies considerably depending upon the conditions of use**. The SAR value used for FCC approval does not account for the multitude of measurements taken during the testing. Moreover, **cell phones constantly vary their power to operate at the minimum power necessary for communications**; **operation at maximum power occurs infrequently**. \n\n> Second, **the reported highest SAR values of wireless devices do not necessarily indicate that a user is exposed to more or less RF energy from one cell phone than from another during normal use** \n>> For additional information, see\u00a0[SAR and cell phones](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cell-phones-what-it-means-you). \n\n> Third, **the variation in SAR from one mobile device to the next is relatively small compared to the reduction that can be achieved by the measures described above**. Consumers should remember that **all wireless devices are certified to meet the FCC maximum SAR standards, which incorporate a considerable safety margin.** \n>> For additional information, see [maximum SAR value for each phone](https://www.fcc.gov/general/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cellular-telephones).\n\nSome studies have also reported that wireless devices might interfere with implanted cardiac pacemakers \n\n>...if used within **eight inches** of the pacemaker. \n\nAlthough several studies claim health risks associated with wireless and EMF radiation, there is still much work to be done before definitive statements about EMF safety can be made. Because these health risks are of concern to you, it may be advisable to take precautionary measures by placing your router at an appropriate distance from your body, especially while sleeping. However, it is best to discuss any health-related questions or concerns with your primary care physician or specialist. \n\nAs a side note - you may also want to review the specs on the [Asus RT-AC5300 router](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RT-AC5300/specifications/) listed on the Asus website and request additional product documentation from the company to review with your primary care physician or specialist.\n<hr />\n\nSupplemental information and resources: \n\n[Wireless Devices and Health Concerns Guide](http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/mobilephone.pdf)\n\n[Radio Frequency Safety](https://www.fcc.gov/general/radio-frequency-safety-0)\n\n[CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta Explains: Cell phones and radiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqCDrHXgtd0)\n\n[Cell Phone Radiation Safety Tips With Dr Sanjay Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7wCeuSqm34)", "14401": "First of all: even brushing with nothing \u2013 except the dry brush \u2013 is better for dental hygiene than doing nothing at all. Before the invention of the [tooth brush][1] people were actively caring for their teeth. One interesting example is found in the \"[toothbrush tree][2]\", which has a number of beneficial attributes.\n\nTo address the questions:\n\n1. Abrasiveness is usually no big problem for the gums. Tooth enamel is another story, but: \n[Baking soda as an abrasive in toothpastes: Mechanism of action and safety and effectiveness considerations:][3] \n> **Conclusions:**\nOn the basis of the collected evidence, baking soda has an intrinsic low-abrasive nature because of its comparatively lower hardness in relation to enamel and dentin. Baking soda toothpastes also may contain other ingredients, which can increase their stain removal effectiveness and, consequently, abrasivity.<br>\n**Practical Implications:**\nEven those formulations have abrasivity well within the safety limit regulatory agencies have established and, therefore, can be considered safe.\n\n2. For plastic retainers *after rinsing* in your mouth? Totally inert.\n\n3. If you do not have a regular toothpaste, *then* baking soda is a nice alternative. But fluoride containing pastes are usually considered way superior. For \"remineralisation\": [tooth enamel][4] is mainly built from [hydroxylapatite][5]. Sodium bicarbonate is usually very low in Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, that is calcium, phosphorous, or beneficial trace elements like strontium and fluoride. <br> The *direct* contribution to remineralisation has to be considered zero. The neutralising effect of the soda\n([Evidence for biofilm acid neutralization by baking soda][6]) might contribute a little bit to enable the natural capacity of your saliva to remineralise. \n\n4. Test the baking soda on any piece of plastic, like a  bowl or a cup. It will not do anything to it.\n\n\nThat might look very safe and effective now. Reading certain studies just emphasises this:\n> [Stain removal and whitening by baking soda dentifrice: A review of literature:][7] <br>\n**Conclusions:**\nThe evidence available in the literature indicates that baking soda-based dentifrices are effective and safe for tooth stain removal and consequently whitening. A number of clinical studies have also shown that baking soda-based dentifrices are more effective in stain removal and whitening than some non-baking soda-containing dentifrices with a higher abrasivity. So far, research efforts have mainly focused on stain removal and tooth-whitening efficacy and clinical safety of baking soda dentifrices used with manual toothbrushes, with only a few studies investigating their effects using powered toothbrushes, for which further research is encouraged.\n> **Practical Implications:**\nAs part of a daily oral hygiene practice, baking soda-based dentifrice is a desirable, alternative or additional measure for tooth stain removal and whitening.\n\nBut this should not be misread! <br>\nAll of the above just says that the plan from the question is not really dangerous. Baking soda and xylitol may even be a quite clever combination compared to soda alone. <br>\nComparing toothpaste on this basis with regular paste containing fluoride shows the  superiority of added fluoride for maintaining oral health in numerous studies, for example:\n> [Comparing three toothpastes in controlling plaque and gingivitis: A 6-month clinical study:][8]<br>\n> After 6 months, subjects assigned to the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride group exhibited statistically significant reductions in gingival index scores and plaque index scores as compared to subjects assigned to the herbal/bicarbonate group by 35.4% and 48.9%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in gingival index and plaque index between subjects in the herbal/ bicarbonate group and those in the fluoride group. The triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice was statistically significantly more effective in reducing gingivitis and dental plaque than the herbal/bicarbonate dentifrice, and this difference in efficacy was clinically meaningful.\n\nThat means unless your local drinking water is very high in fluoride or you drink large amounts of green or black tea (containing large amounts of fluoride) tooth pastes with fluoride will be much better at protecting dental health.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush#History\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadora_persica\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056187\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056184\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056186\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26087570", "14089": "**Question:** Does reducing the sweetness of a drink by diluting it with water reduces the likelihood of acne?\n\n**Short answer:** Not necessary.\n\nI am not aware of any study that would show an association between the mere *sweetness* of a food and the risk of acne.\n\nThere is some evidence that **low-glycemic load diet** may help reduce acne ([Cochrane][1], [PubMed Central][2]).\n\nGlycemic load = glycemic index x grams of carbohydrates in the food.

So, the diluted beverage passes from the stomach into the intestine faster, which results in faster glucose absorption and thus in higher GI.\n\nTo decrease the glycemic load of the meals, you can decrease the amount of high glycemic index foods, for example, eating whole-grain bread (high in fiber) instead of white flour products (low in fiber).\n\n  [1]: http://www.cochrane.org/CD009436/SKIN_complementary-therapies-acne-vulgaris\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4106357/\n  [3]: https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods\n  [4]: http://www.glycemicindex.com/faqsList.php\n  [5]: https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-6-9", "13627": "What is reported here about the \"wound care specialist\" sounds like being either badly phrased by the doctor or misunderstood, misremembered or phrased rather unluckily by the OP (no offence, just speculation).\n\nWhatever the reason for this unsatisfactory status of explanation: This treatment is likely not focused on the nitrate part of the formulation alone.\n\n[*Silver* nitrate][1] is likely [employed][2] to [help with the healing process][3].

Fresh scars will be more easily influenced than older ones.\n\nIf this is the goal then there seem to be some options in that general direction:\n\n- [Silicone-based scar therapy: a review of the literature.][1]\n- [Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.][2]\n- [Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products.][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354695\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24030657\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17312518", "13474": "The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia states that tolerance does develop upon repeated use 'Tolerance and dependence of the amfetamine type develop on repeated administration of \ndexamfetamine.'

In fact, doctors have begun to support laughter therapy to complement traditional treatments for injuries and diseases like cancer. From research, it does seem like laughter **is** the best medicine (in compliment to other traditional medicine).\n\nPsychologists studying the science of happiness believe that practising certain positive behaviours like laughter can bring the pleasure, engagement and meaning that comprise happiness ([Jameson, 2008][1])\n\nSome serving in the military are being trained to use genuine and forced laughter as stress relievers to help prevent and treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that can result from harrowing experiences like combat duty ([Burbank, 2006][2])\n\n[According to helpguide.org][3],\n\n> **Laughter relaxes the whole body**. A good, hearty laugh relieves physical tension and stress, leaving your muscles relaxed for up to 45 minutes after.\n>\n**Laughter boosts the immune system**. Laughter decreases stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, thus improving your resistance to disease. ([See also @JohnP's answer][4] in the Health Stack Exchange question [Does laughing improve immune system?][5])\n>\n**Laughter triggers the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good chemicals**. Endorphins promote an overall sense of well-being and can even temporarily relieve pain.\n>\n**Laughter protects the heart**. Laughter improves the function of blood vessels and increases blood flow, which can help protect you against a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.\n>\n**Laughter burns calories**. OK, so it\u2019s no replacement for going to the gym, but one study found that laughing for 10 to 15 minutes a day can burn about 40 calories\u2014which could be enough to lose three or four pounds over the course of a year.\n>\n**Laughter lightens anger\u2019s heavy load**. Nothing diffuses anger and conflict faster than a shared laugh. Looking at the funny side can put problems into perspective and enable you to move on from confrontations without holding onto bitterness or resentment.\n>\n**Laughter may even help you to live longer**. A study in Norway found that people with a strong sense of humor outlived those who don't laugh as much. The difference was particularly notable for those battling cancer.\n\nPaediatric hospitals also use therapeutic forms of entertainment like clown therapy to help children tolerate the pain, nausea and anxiety associated with chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The 1998 movie \"Patch Adams\" was based on the real-life story of a doctor who used humour to treat patients while he was still in medical school. Patch Adams and his colleagues at the Gesundheit Institute in Virginia use a combination of clowning, singing and dancing to treat patients through entertainment in conjunction with traditional medicine ([Gesundheit Institute][6]).\n\nOther internet sites including [How Stuff Works \u2014 Science][7] states\n\n> Laughter sets off a chain reaction throughout the body that promotes physical and psychological health. Regular and frequent guffawing can both prevent illness and help you get well. Laughter lowers your body's hormone and cortisol levels. (Cortisol is a stress-induced chemical that can lead to heart disease, high blood pressure and excess belly fat.) Laughter also strengthens your immune system because it increases the production of antibodies in your saliva and in your bloodstream to stave off bacteria, viruses and parasites.\n\nLaughter also helps with skin conditions. People suffering from eczema noted improvement in their complexions after consistently watching funny movies. When allergy patients laugh regularly, it reportedly shrinks their welts ([Kimata, 2009][8]).\n\nSome cancer treatment centres incorporate laughter therapy sessions into a patient's treatment plan to increase the positive thinking and happy feelings that support the healing process ([CTCA, n.d.][9])\n\nAs for laughter curing diabetes, I don't know about curing diabetes, but as How Stuff Works \u2014 Science states that laughter reduces cortisol levels which can lead to excess belly fat [getting rid of belly fat may lower Type 2 diabetes risk][10].  So diabetes might not be able to be cured by laughter, but laughter **can prevent** Type 2 Diabetes.\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\nBurbank, L. 2006. *The Growing Popularity of Laughter Therapy* NPR [Online]<br>\n(Transcript) http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5165226<br>\n(MP3 Audio) https://ondemand.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/day/2006/01/20060120_day_11.mp3\n\nCTCA, n.d. *Laughter therapy* Cancer Treatment Centers of America [Online]<br>http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy\n\nJameson, M. 2008. *C'mon, get happy* Los Angeles Times [Online]<br>\nhttp://www.latimes.com/la-he-happy8-2008sep08-story.html\n\nKimata, H. 2009. *Viewing a humorous film decreases IgE production by seminal B cells from patients with atopic eczema* Journal of Psychosomatic Research 26(2): pp 173\u2013175<br>\nDOI: [10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.06.006][11] PMID: [19154860][12]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.latimes.com/la-he-happy8-2008sep08-story.html\n  [2]: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5165226\n  [3]: https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm\n  [4]: https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4526\n  [5]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4477\n  [6]: http://www.patchadams.org/patch-adams/\n  [7]: http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/laughter-cure-illness.htm\n  [8]: http://www.jpsychores.com/article/S0022-3999(08)00290-0/fulltext\n  [9]: http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/\n  [10]: http://www.health.com/health/condition-article/0,,20188164,00.html\n  [11]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.06.006\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19154860", "12528": "More physical activity would very probably be a good idea.\nBody fat distribution has [genetic determinants][1], and you cannot really target a body area for fat reduction.

For example, here is a case study of a patient with weak type A blood (much of the research is on that, as it is more common than weak type B): [A weak blood group A phenotype caused by a translation-initiator mutation in the ABO gene.][3]\n\n*Blood donors*\n\nBasically, weak type A or B blood donors's blood may be mistyped as being type O. If it is given to recipients with blood type O, these patients may experience blood agglutination which can be dangerous. \n\n> Identification of these subgroups is important because these donors may be mistyped as group O individuals. Wrongly grouped as O, weak subgroups of A or B red cells (if transfused to O group individuals) can show decreased survival. \n\nThis does not concern your case, as it is about weak type A, but I'm including this for completeness sake: One of the weak type A groups, A<sub>x</sub> is special, in that people with this blood type should not donate for people with type A blood, as they actually have antibodies against the dominant type A antigen. \n\n> Similarly since Ax individuals almost always have anti-A1 antibodies in their serum. If clinically significant, they can lead to fatal transfusion reactions on transfusing their whole blood or plasma to group A individuals. \n\n*Blood recipients*\n\nNone of the sources I could find went into much detail what this meant for receiving blood transfusions. None mentioned not being able to receive type A or B blood if the patient is a weak type A or B. \n\nBeing mistyped as O when receiving blood is not going to lead to any major problems - however, it means the person will only receive type O blood and not type A or B blood. In situations with a donor blood shortage this might be a disadvantage. \n\nThe researchers of the study told the donors, so they would know that their blood could not be given to a type O patient. \n\n> All the donors were personally informed about their group and were given a special blood group card clarifying their donor as well as recipient status. \n\nYou might want to give your child something similar to carry around with them.

In my opinion, *dieting* is an incredibly vague term. Ensuring you are eating a balanced diet and eating within your daily needs is better way to put it.\n\nWhen you consume an excess of calories that your body doesn't need it often stores this fat independently, for future use i.e. as an energy source. [Fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat), despite the bad rep, [is a very good energy source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6778757) and is essential in our diets - more specifically in times of (unintentional?) fasting. Is it healthy to use fat as a stable for your energy needs? No. It's all about maintaining a justified ratio of Carbohydrates; fats and proteins that build a stable foundation for a diet. \n\nConsider this when contemplating a weight loss diet: 'In 2005, the \u201cAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition\u201d published the results of a study in which subjects who ate [30% protein, 20% fats and 50% carbohydrates](http://www.livestrong.com/article/303969-the-protein-fat-and-carbohydrate-ratio-for-losing-weight/) felt fuller and ate an average of more than 400 fewer calories daily when compared to subjects who ate a diet of 15% protein, 35% fats and 50% carbohydrates. \n\nThe most abundant method for weight loss that is clinically proven, would be obtaining a prescription for [*Orlistat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlistat), aka Alli. Additionally, you will only be able to obtain this medicine if you are truly overweight and if you are have \"fair\" reasoning etc.\n\n[Orlistat](http://www.webmd.boots.com/diet/guide/medicine-for-obesity) belongs to drug class called *Lipase inhibitors*. Lipase is the in situ enzyme that breaks down lipids (fats), so that they can effectively be absorbed by our body, and hence inhibiting this enzyme allows most of the fat we consume to pass through our digestive system, to be release via excretion in our fecal matter. It would be fair to say that this treatment is in favor of resisting storage/absorption some types of fat more than others. In this case it's [visceral fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue#Obesity) - fat stored in the abdominal cavity and hence around our major organs. Knowing this, you should be able to comprehend how a physician may deem you suitable for a prescription. If he/she concludes that you are overweight and predisposed to risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, the decision will tilt in your favor.\n\nEdit: Orlistat is the generic name for the \"weight loss\" aid not sold over-the- counter.

Studies using 5% (w/w) clover honey had no effect on Steptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrukeii subsp bulgaricus and probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.\n\nYou are correct that honey has been found to have antimicrobial properties against a wide range of pathogens. However, these studies are done for the scenario of using undiluted honey as a wound dressing. For example, from a recent study:\n\n>For at least 2700 years, honey has been used by humans to treat a variety of ailments *through topical application*, but only recently have the antiseptic and antimicrobial properties of honey been discovered. ...Clinical studies have demonstrated that application of honey to severely infected cutaneous wounds rapidly clears infection from the wound and improves tissue healing. \n\nThe broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of honey are confirmed but the exact mechanism is unclear; it could be due to the acidity, honey's osmotic effect, presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal factors (hydrogen peroxide, antioxidants, lysozyme, polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, methylglyoxal, and bee peptides), etc. \n\nFrom a review atricle,\n\n>A bacterial level greater than 10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of wound tissue has been found to have a deleterious effect on wound healing in surgical and chronic wounds. [This article discusses] the inherent complexities of the clinical use of medical-grade honey... and to select clinical entities in patients who may benefit from treatment with medical-grade honey, using the evidence indicators such as the Cochrane reviews.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that the antibacterial properties of honey are more complex than just high sugar content alone (which decreases tissue fluid to which it is applied, inhibiting bacterial growth.) As referred to above, honey contains an enzyme that converts glucose to hydrogen peroxide, an antibacterial agent. Also, as you mentioned, the antibacterial properties of honey appear to vary depending on the floral source. \n\n>Honey derived from Leptospermum trees (manuka) or Echium vulgare bush (viper's bugloss) showed antibacterial properties independent of hydrogen peroxide. It is believed that another, yet undiscovered, component of honey is responsible for the antibacterial properties.\n\nAs mentioned above, phenols are significant:\n\n>Antioxidant potential was dependent of honey extract concentration and the results showed that dark honey phenolic compounds had higher activity than the obtained from clear honey.\n\nThere have been interesting studies of susceptibility of food-borne pathogen to honey, or potential for treatment of stomach ulcers with honey, but these are *in vitro* \n\n>Assessment of the minimum inhibitory concentration by inclusion of manuka honey in the agar showed that all seven isolates tested had visible growth over the incubation period of 72 h prevented completely by the presence of **5%** (v/v) honey. \n\nEven in vitro, significant minimum inhibitory concentration started at about 9%, and against some organisms, 25%.\n\nOne paper isolating methylglyoxal (MGO) (and other agents) found Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey had very high amounts of MGO, up to 100-fold higher compared to conventional honeys. \n\n>Whereas most of the honey samples investigated showed no inhibition in dilutions of 80% (v/v with water) or below, the samples of Manuka honey exhibited antibacterial activity when diluted to 15\u201330%, which corresponded to MGO concentrations of 1.1\u20131.8 mM. This clearly demonstrates that the pronounced antibacterial activity of New Zealand Manuka honey directly originates from MGO.\n\nAll this is to say concentration (as well as the source of the honey) matters. If one of the most consistently antibacterial honeys (manuka)has to be present in concentrations of at least 15% to be significantly antibacterial in vitro, unless you're chugging manuka honey, I don't *think* it will have a deleterious effect on your intestinal flora.\n\n\n\n<sub>[Growth and Acid Production by Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria Grown in Skim Milk Containing Honey](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2001.tb16134.x/abstract)</sub>\n<sub>[Antimicrobial Properties of Honey](http://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2014/07000/Antimicrobial_Properties_of_Honey.13.aspx)</sub>  \n<sub>[Use of Honey in Wound Care: An Update](http://journals.lww.com/aswcjournal/Fulltext/2011/01000/Use_of_Honey_in_Wound_Care__An_Update.11.aspx)</sub>  \n<sub>[Antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of phenolic compounds extracts of Northeast Portugal honey](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691508005607)</sub>  \n<sub>[Susceptibility of Helicobacter Pylori to the Antibacterial Activity of Manuka Honey](http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/87/1/9.short)</sub>  \n<sub>[The antibacterial properties of Malaysian tualang honey against wound and enteric microorganisms in comparison to manuka honey](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/34/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Identification and quantification of methylglyoxal as the dominant antibacterial constituent of Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honeys from New Zealand](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200700282/abstract)</sub>  ", "3157": "There is evidence of analgesic effects of menthol in scientific literature.

In mice blockage of voltage gated Na-channels** of dorsal root ganglion neurons has shed light on potential mechanisms of analgesic action.\n\nHere are the key parts of these studies:\n\n[A comparison of topical menthol to ice on pain, evoked tetanic and voluntary force during delayed onset muscle soreness](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3362986/) has shown that:\n\n> Compared to ice, the topical menthol-based analgesic decreased perceived discomfort to a greater extent and permitted greater tetanic forces to be produced. [...] Tetanic force changes illustrated a significant main effect for the treatments (p<0.05; ES=1.1) with the menthol based topical analgesic allowing 116.9% greater tetanic force (89.4 N \u00b1 60.7) output than the ice treatment (41.2 \u00b1 43.6). [...]  There was a significant (p=0.025; ES=1.2) difference in soreness perception with the VAS scale between the application of ice and the menthol based topical analgesic. Soreness perception was 63.1% less with application of the topical analgesic (1.1 \u00b1 0.4) compared to the ice (3.1 \u00b1 1.7).\n\nIn this study menthol was applied as 3.5% gel (Biofreeze\u00ae) without substantial force or rubbing during application.\n\nAside from cooling sensation attributed to activation of TRPM8 channel in this and other studies, another study ([Menthol pain relief through cumulative inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395911006907)) has tested the hypothesis that menthol could block voltage gated Na-channels:\n\n>  The results indicate that menthol inhibits Na+ channels in a concentration-, voltage-, and frequency-dependent manner. Menthol promoted fast and slow inactivation states, causing use-dependent depression of Na+ channel activity. In current clamp recordings, menthol inhibited firing at high-frequency stimulation with minimal effects on normal neuronal activity. We found that low concentrations of menthol cause analgesia in mice, relieving pain produced by a Na+ channel-targeting toxin. We conclude that menthol is a state-selective blocker of Nav1.8, Nav1.9, and TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, indicating a role for Na+ channel blockade in the efficacy of menthol as topical analgesic compound.\n\n[Acute Effect of Topical Menthol on Chronic Pain in Slaughterhouse Workers with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Triple-Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/rerp/2014/310913/):\n\n> Topical gel containing menthol led to a 31% (1.3 point on 0\u201310 VAS) acute reduction in chronic pain associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, and the absolute change in pain symptoms between topical menthol and placebo was 1.2 corresponding to a moderate effect size\n\n\n__________________________________\n\nIn official monographs one can find predominantly Peppermint oil (*Menthae piperitae aetheroleum*), but since literature states that menthol is it's main ingredient (30 - 55% [WHO]) we could assume that it plays a role in the effects of the oil.\n\n- [In Community Herbal Monograph by European Medicines Agency (EMeA)](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Herbal_-_Community_herbal_monograph/2010/01/WC500059313.pdf):\n\nTraditional use, indication 2:\n> For the symptomatic relief of localised  muscle pain  \n\n- In [WHO Monographs on selected medicinal plants, Volume 2](http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4927e/19.html):\n\n> Uses supported by clinical data\n>\n> Internally for symptomatic treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (15-20), and digestive disorders such as flatulence and gastritis (21-23). **Externally for treatment of myalgia and headache** (21, 24-27)\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n- Commission E (translated into English at [American Botanical Council](http://cms.herbalgram.org/expandedE/Peppermintoil.html)) \n\n> The Commission E approved the internal use of peppermint oil for spastic discomfort of the upper gastrointestinal tract and bile ducts, irritable colon (in enteric-coated capsules), catarrhs of the respiratory tract, and inflammation of the oral mucosa; **and external use for myalgia and neuralgia.**\n>\n> ESCOP [...] Its external use is indicated for coughs and colds, **rheumatic complaints**, pruritus, urticaria, and pain in irritable skin conditions (ESCOP, 1997). \n\n*To show the lack of bias: not an official monograph, but a respected resource, PDR for Herbal Medicines lists the cutaneous use of peppermint oil as an analgesic in myalgia and neuralgia as \"unproven uses\".", "1517": "You start with your doctor. You can also learn about how memory is made from reading new material.\n\nNo one can answer you over the internet regarding your particular problem; a neurologist would be able to test you for serious health problems regarding your memory, ability to concentrate, etc. But a few general guidelines can be given that might help those young, healthy people who feel they have mentally \"slowed down\".\n\nPeople of all ages can have problems with their thyroid gland. Virtually every cell in your body is dependent on this *master gland's* product. Both hypothryoidism and hyperthyroidism can affect thinking, from subtly to profoundly.<sup>[1]</sup>  If your diet is deficient in any way, tests for that can be done as well.\n\nYou are very young for early onset Alzheimer's & Dementia, but you can be tested for that as well. (The likelihood of having such a cognitive impairment with no other symptoms whatsoever - and without anyone else noticing it - are small.)\n\nMany, many people worry about their ability to concentrate. I remember feeling mentally sluggish enough decades ago to take the then much-touted herbal supplement *ginko biloba* (it hasn't been shown to do anything; don't waste your money.) The point is, that was three decades ago, I was young, concerned, and in a demanding profession, and I'm fine.\n\nCognitive science has given us some good information about learning; maybe this will help people identify when memory problems are \"normal\". Here, I'll deal mainly with reading, concentration, and learning together. And since it might all be new to you, you will very likely need to read it more than once.\n\nCognitive load theory and schema (learning) theory<sup>[2][3]</sup> go hand in hand in *learning*. *Schemas* are frameworks of information (imagine an empty skyscraper in your mind; you want to fill those rooms with what each needs to work and communicate with other rooms, so that in the end, you'll have a pretty-well functioning skyscraper with communication between all the departments.) \n\nSchemas start as very basic (\"This is a cell\") and become more complex and facile (\"NADH-Q oxidoreductase, Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, and cytochrome c oxidase are mitochondrial transmembranous enzyme complexes responsible for oxidative phosphorylation, etc.\") Schemas allow (and are the basic unit of) *Long Term Memory* (LTM). To learn something, we need a framework (\"cell\") into which we can stick a fact before we can remember it for more than a very few minutes. (Do you think you can remember what you just read about \"mitochondrial transmembranous enzyme complexes\"? I highly doubt it.)\n\nThe more we know about something (the better our schemas are), the more easily we learn. *Working memory* (WM) allows us to process what we are exposed to and place it *into a schema* so that we can remember it. Like a computer, we have limited working memory (processing ability) available to us at any given time. Efficient processing results in placing material into a schema which then facilitates Long Term Memory (LTM). Efficient processing -> Long Term Memory (LTM). \n\n>- Inefficient Processing (IP) -> *\"What Did I Just Read?\"* (I know I read it, I know it was in a language I understand, I understood it, but I can't remember what it said.) IP blocks schema identification which then blocks LTM. Failed schema identification means leads to inability to use information.\n>\n>- Efficient processing (EP) -> *\"OK, That Makes Sense; What's Next?\"* (This relates to things I know; how does it relate to things I'm about to be exposed to?) EP allows schema identification which then allows LTM.\n\nWhere does cognitive load come in? Cognitive Load takes up processing speed (reducing working memory). If cognitive load is great enough, all working memory is used up, and we will be unable to identify/form a schema. \n\nThere are several types of Cognitive load: \n\n- *intrinsic* (how complex is the information?)\n- *extrinsic*/ineffective (a bunch of things including distractions, emotionally demanding states [stress, anxiety, even the anxiety you feel when you see something new], and especially *the way in which material is presented*, i.e. does it induce splitting of attention? etc.) \n- *germane* (what's left over to actually form schemas). They are (kind of) additive. Good schemas *reduce* cognitive load (increasing working memory).\n\nThey are (kind of) additive. Good schemas reduce cognitive load thereby increasing working memory.\n\nIf you are reading at your limit of working memory, one final additional 'load' (resulting in cognitive overload) will make you unable to remember what you have just/will immediately read. \n\nBecause cognitive overload *does not disappear immediately upon reduction of load*, you need a few moments to experience reduced load before you regain working memory. \n\nAn example: you read something while at the very edge of working memory. You realize that you have not remembered what you read, so you decrease attention splits (you commit to reread with intent.) Because you need a few moments of reduced load before your second reading, it might not sink in (now you become concerned, further increasing cognitive load), whereas if you got up, sipped water, and sat down again, you might have enough recovery time to regain working memory.\n\nIn an interview with Felipe De Brigard, PhD of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University, He emphasizes the importance of good sleep and giving learning tasks one's full attention:\n \n>- I also like to highlight the importance of attending to the information we want to encode. In today's world, people love to multitask. But, unfortunately, multitasking is very detrimental to memory consolidation. Attention and working memory are of the essence for information to be encoded. If you divide your attention between two events, you fail to fully encode either of them; at best, you end up half-encoding both of them. \n\nA very minor example of cognitive overload: if 100 people write *which* or *else* or other word you're familiar with 30 times in one minute, ~70% will begin to doubt that it is a real word. This is because of the increase of extrinsic load resulting in cognitive overload.\n\nYou might pay attention when your mind starts to not absorb material to see if anything like this is going on (How well is the material presented? Am I experiencing distractions (\"not having so many surrounding words helps\")? Am I feeling stressed? Does a short break/turning off the music/etc. help? Try reading something undemanding (a line in a recipe  book if you like cooking, or a few lines from a favorite book you've read a few times. Is your memory better with this more familiar and less working-memory-requiring information?)\n\nThe linked site presents different models of presenting information that promotes schema formation, identification and processing in different situations, and links to further work.\n\n<sub>[1 Thyroid hormones, learning and memory.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17543038)</sub>  \n<sub>[2 COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY, LEARNING DIFFICULTY, AND INSTRUCTIONAL  DESIGN](http://coral.ufsm.br/tielletcab/Apostilas/cognitive_load_theory_sweller.pdf)</sub>   \n<sub>[3 Schema Theory and Cognitive Load Theory](http://prezi.com/1apjupioiqts/schema-theory-and-cognitive-load-theory/)</sup> \n\n<sub>General references</sub>   \n<sub>[Mild cognitive impairment](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment/basics/definition/con-20026392)</sub>   \n<sub>[Mild Cognitive Impairment: Clinical Characterization and Outcome](http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=774828)</sub>  \n<sub>[Younger/Early Onset Alzheimer's and Dementia](http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_early_onset.asp)</sub>      \n  \n    \n\n<sub>[]()</sub>      \n\n", "1254": "Yes. \n\nThis is one of the few areas of [primary prevention][pp]* where the data are clear. \n\nThe (intelligently) skeptical tone of your question suggests to me that you would be (appropriately) wary of drawing conclusions based on [observational data][od] or [surrogate endpoints][se]. Fortunately, you have asked a question about an area where rigorous data are available showing reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality on the basis of randomized, controlled trials.\n\n**Cardiovascular events**  \n\nIn large-scale randomized trials of people with primary hypertension,  antihypertensive therapy produces a nearly 50 percent relative risk reduction in the incidence of heart failure, a 30 to 40 percent relative risk reduction in stroke, and a 20 to 25 percent relative risk reduction in myocardial infarction.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> \n\nThe benefits show a consistent \"dose-response\" relationship. That is, larger improvements in blood pressure control are associated with greater decreases in risk. This is an important point, since it adds credibility to the association. This is demonstrated in graphs like this one:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n<sub>Image from Reference 1, below: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386598/</sub>  \n\nOn the x-axis you see the degree of blood pressure lowering achieved with medications. On the y-axis is \u201crelative risk\u201d (RR). By definition, a null intervention yields RR=1. A relative risk of 0.5 represents a 50% decreased risk, etc. \n\nThe graph is showing meta-analysis data, i.e. data compiled from many clinical trials in order to increase statistical power. The basic idea is that each circle is a clinical trial and bigger circles represent \u201cstronger\u201d data (i.e. with lower variance). The regression line shows that there is a linear relationship between the degree of blood pressure lowering and the relative risk reduction (here for a composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.) This analysis included 31 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with 190,606 participants. These are strong data. \n\n**Mortality data**  \n\nIn addition to the dramatic reductions in adverse cardiovascular outcomes, blood pressure control has also been shown to reduce mortality. One meta-analysis used data from 42 randomized, controlled studies including nearly 200,000 subjects (Psaty). They found a reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). The fact that these relative risk (RR) confidence intervals do not cross 1 demonstrates statistical significance. \n\nAlthough the RR value of 0.90 is considerably less impressive than the reductions in more specific outcomes (stroke, heart failure, etc), this is expected due to the myriad of other factors affecting mortality. A statistically significant relative risk of 0.90 for **mortality** is actually quite dramatic. One would be challenged to find any other intervention for primary prevention that, in randomized trials, can be shown to decrease overall mortality with this degree of certainty.\n\n**Conclusion**  \n\nThere are many interventions in modern medicine that are of questionable long-term benefit to healthy patients (i.e. primary prevention).** These include cholesterol lowering medications, aspirin, various forms of cancer screening, etc. In most cases, the disease-specific improvements in outcomes are subtle and debated, and randomized data showing a reduction in overall mortality are lacking or inconsistent. The use of blood pressure lowering medications in patients with hypertension falls into a different category. These medications are effective. \n\n<sub>\n*That is, interventions aimed at preventing disease in *healthy* people. This is in contrast to *secondary* prevention, treating people after they have already had an adverse outcome. In general, secondary prevention is a much \"easier\" arena in which to demonstrate benefit because the risk of adverse outcomes is so much higher.\n</sub>   \n\n<sub>\n**Here, I\u2019m considering hypertension, hyperlipidemia to fall within the range of \u201chealthy\u201d because these abnormalities are only problematic if they cause a cardiovascular event of some sort.\n</sub>\n\n------\n**References**  \n\n1.

So shampooing in the modern sense (water to produce a soapy lather) is only about 100 years old.\n\nOur modern shampoos are a combination of [surfactants][1] (such as [SLS][2]) which dissolve natural oils ([sebum][3]) and remove dirt particles. As result, it reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp making it drier than usual, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate.\n\nAccording to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo causes [sebaceous glands][4] to produce sebum at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and in the hair<sup>[2009][5]</sup>.\n\nMichelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University explains:\n\n> If you wash your hair every day, you're removing the sebum, then the oil glands compensate by producing more oil\"\n\nShe recommends that patients wash their hair no more than two or three times a week.\n\nIn the 2010 book Packing for Mars, Soviet research said<sup>[2010][6]</sup>:\n\n> the skin halts its production of sebum\u2014after five to seven days of not bathing\n\nHowever this could vary greatly from person to person, as some people could respond better to some products with different concentrations of surfactants.\n\nFor example if you have \"oily hair\" you need a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils, when you have \"dry and frizzy hair\", it would exacerbate the problem.\n\nIn 2007 radio audition, Australian [Richard Glover][7] decided to challenge his audience to go without shampoo for six weeks. 86 percent of those who 500 people who participated reported that \"their hair was either better or the same\"<sup>[wiki][16]</sup>.\n\n\n### Studies\n\nA [study from 1997][8] showed a link between excessive oil production and anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide. \n\n>  Study was conducted in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary antidandruff shampoos on sebum flow dynamic.\n>\n>  Two shampoos exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output.\n>\n> Only a few topical products are known to decrease the sebum output at the skin surface:\n>\n> Among them, the effect of progesterone, astringents, erythromycin-zinc complex, corticosteroids, and elubiol have been documented.\n\nFor older studies, see: [1968][9], [1983][10]\n\nIn 2013, the FDA announced that triclosan was found to affect hormone levels in animals<sup>[FDA][11]</sup>.\n\n> Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. However, data showing effects in animals don\u2019t always predict effects in humans.\n\nA recent study from 2014 showed that shampooing impact on cortisol levels in human hair:\n\n> Chemical processing and frequent shampooing affect cortisol levels measured in hair. Chemically processed or excessively shampooed hair should be avoided when recruiting subjects for hair cortisol studies.\n\nBased on above it seems that chemical properties in modern shampoos can affect our hormones, however more studies needs to be conducted to see how exactly it affects our natural oil production ([sebum][12]).\n\n\nRead more:\n\n- [Ditching shampoo a dirty little beauty secret][13] at NBC\n- [When It Comes To Shampoo, Less Is More][14] at NPR\n- [Of Course I Washed My Hair Last Year][15]\n- Curly Girl by Michele Bender (2002)\n- [No poo][16] (**no** sham**poo**) at Wikipedia\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland\n  [5]: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780393068474\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Glover_(radio_presenter)\n  [8]: http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1997/cc048n02/p00117-p00121.pdf\n  [9]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4177572\n  [10]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6580909\n  [11]: http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland\n  [13]: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30337386/ns/health-skin_and_beauty/t/ditching-shampoo-dirty-little-beauty-secret/#.VS_UjJTF9v1\n  [14]: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969\n  [15]: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/fashion/21SKINOne.html\n  [16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_poo", "1136": "**Oil-Pulling<br/>**\n\n> Oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic practice that essentially involves\n> swishing around oil in the mouth.

As fasting progresses, however, metabolic rate decreases as free\n> T3 and catecholamine levels decrease and the rate of gluconeogenesis\n> decreases.\n\nIn essence, when you first start to fast (the references[ \\[1][2],[2\\] ][3]that the review sites are from 1-4 days in this section) the body looks to other sources of energy ([gluconeogenesis][4]).  That is not sustainable over time, and then the BMR begins to drop.  How it begins to drop is largely through the lost of lean tissue, with a focus on muscle mass, which is probably a good evolutionary choice over more important systems such as the brain:\n\n> The response to a less severe degree of food restriction can also be\n> seen as a series of adaptive processes with the same priorities, that\n> is to maintain the supply of glucose to the brain and to minimise the\n> loss of lean tissue. Basal metabolic rate decreases to minimise the\n> negative energy balance. This is achieved partly by loss of\n> metabolically active tissue, but there is also some evidence that the\n> efficiency of energy metabolism increases leading to a decrease in\n> energy expenditure per unit cell mass.\n\nAgain, the [referenced review article][5] is also worth a read, especially as it deals with otherwise healthy individuals and people \"dieting\" in the common sense of the word (but in no means the medical).  Again body composition and physical activity take a leading role here, but changes in efficiency are certainly noted if not understood.  A conclusion reached on efficiency calculation ([ibid][5]) is also worth quoting:\n\n> It would thus appear that the generally used indicator of metabolic\n> efficiency in humans, that is a reduced oxygen consumption per unit\n> fat free mass, is fraught with problems since it does not account for\n> variations in contributions from sub-compartments of the fat free mass\n> which include those with high metabolism at rest such as brain and\n> viscera and those with low metabolism at rest such as muscle mass.\n\n\nWhen in your life span you start on your low caloric diet can effect the outcome of the diet.  A commonly understood example is a shorter stature/smaller skeletal frame will develop under limited nutritional intake.  It's probably worth noting that on an evolutionary scale, having too many calories is an exceedingly new problem.  In other words, even if we wouldn't see it as preferential in the developed world today, it is probably an adaptive response to lose lean body mass or not develop additional skeletal structure (with goals of efficiency).  \n\nI will end returning [Dr. Emery's][1] coverage of the same topic:\n\n> The main response in chronically malnourished populations is slow\n> growth rate, delayed maturity, and small adult stature. Small stature\n> can be seen as a successful adaptation to low-energy intake because\n> overall basal metabolic rate will be low. However, when metabolic rate\n> is adjusted for fat-free mass there is no significant difference\n> between those who are most malnourished and those who are well\n> nourished. The reason for this is that the main deficit in lean\n> tissue mass is in muscle, which has a relatively low metabolic rate,\n> while the size of the visceral organs, which are much more\n> metabolically active, is much less affected. Hence these changes in\n> body composition may cancel out any increase in the efficiency of\n> cellular metabolism.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v19/n10/full/6701959a.html#bib14\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837292?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10365978?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg", "1012": "Modern evidence-based medicine won't be able to fully answer your question, but there are indications that [bacteria, or more exactly, the individual gut flora heavily influence your fecal weight or stool mass](http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/13/1/45.short).

The answer: **because your head was meant to be above your body!**\n\nYour body has very specific mechanisms for maintaining a constant blood flow in the cerebral circulation despite shifts in blood pressure, either due to changing blood pressure in the rest of the circulation or due to a different 'local' pressure because of position . This is termed *autoregulation*.\n\nThe blood pressure that the brain 'sees' is called 'cerebral perfusion pressure' (CPP). Technically CPP is the difference between intra-arterial pressure and the pressure in the veins, but venous pressure is very low (2-5 mm Hg), so we can estimate it as the arterial blood pressure (here, a weighted average of systolic and diastolic pressures). In a normal person accustomed to normal blood pressures, the body can maintain a constant blood flow of ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute with a CPP range of ~60 to 160 mmHg. That\u2019s a big range!\n\nThe mechanisms of autoregulation are incompletely understood. Most likely reductions in CPP stimulate the release of substances that cause vasodilation (candidates include H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, O<sub>2</sub>, adenosine), thereby increasing flow. On the other side, high pressures stimulate constriction of the myocites in cerebral vessels, reducing flow. \n\nThe end result is that your brain \u2018sees\u2019 a relatively constant pressure regardless of what position you\u2019re in or other factors that may change blood pressure. That having been said, if blood pressure fluctuates outside the range for which auto regulation can accommodate, position does indeed matter for blood pressure. If a patient is markedly hypotensive, for instance, it is traditional to tilt the bed so that their head is below their body.<sup>1</sup> At the extremes, this manipulation can indeed affect blood flow to the brain.  \n\n-----\n<sub>\n1.

The need for braces in the average teen, therefore, is no greater than the average adult. If you think of braces for teens as a necessity, it is no less a necessity for adults, that is, appearance is probably the only significant result for both average teens and adults.\n\nHowever, increased longevity has led to the need to keep healthy teeth for longer periods. Teeth continue to shift throughout life. Missing teeth (today's older adults are more likely to have had dental extractions than younger adults) allow teeth to shift, resulting in malocclusion. Malocclusion in turn can result in frequent inadvertent oral mucosal injuries. This can be corrected with braces.\n\nMissing teeth also mean less occlusive surfaces (chewing surface area). Believe it or not, this poses a choking hazard, as well as decreases a person's ability to enjoy certain foods. Braces or other orthodontic devices may be needed to shift teeth into proper position for bridges to restore occlusive surfaces. Since people are living longer, it makes sense to invest in procedures that will help you to continue to eat well.\n\nRecent reviews of dental literature, however, are showing that the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention in adults are more limited. Malocclusion seems not to have a role in susceptibility to dental caries (as was previously believed), periodontal disease, and temporomandibular joint disorder. Therefor the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention are more limited than previously believed.\n\nFinally, there is some evidence that adult orthodontics can result in harm in the form of root shortening, which can lead to loose teeth.\n\n<sub>[Determinants of masticatory performance in dentate adults](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003996901000231)</sub>  \n<sub>[Dental crowding as a caries risk factor: A systematic review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540612005781)</sub>  \n<sub>[Causal relation between malocclusion and caries](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016358909007704)</sub>  \n", "447": "Alcohol is a psychoactive drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant.\n\nDrinking under-age increases alcohol risks in later life.

There are over 420 different plant species and the most commonly used in consumer products. Most commonly used is Aloe barbadensis, Aloe barbadensis (Mill.) or (Miller) or Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. (scientific name).\n\n### Processing\n\nThe primary component of the plant used in most products is the leaf, which can be processed in two ways to make aloe vera juice, powder or concentrate.\n\nThe other substance found within the leaf that has been used in commerce, primarily as an OTC laxative drug, is the aloe latex. \n\nFor oral consumption Aloe vera needs to be carefully filtered by different processing procedures:\n\n- Aloe vera leaf juice\n\n  A charcoal filtration process which decolorize and remove some of the components (including [anthraquinone][2] which acts as [laxative][3]) as some studies shown to be carcinogenic on rats, but not on mice (see [Toxicity][4]). NTP did not conduct studies of the Aloe vera gel (decolorized whole leaf extracts).\n\n  > Aloe vera leaf juice is made by taking entire aloe vera leaves and grinding them up via some type of maceration. Typically some enzymatic treatment is used (such as cellulase) to break down the rind and heavier-weight materials, and then the resulting slurry is filtered, usually with charcoal filtration, to remove any other unwanted materials such as the aloe latex (yellow, bitter tasting exudate that is a powerful laxative). The remainder is aloe vera leaf juice.\n\n- Aloe vera inner leaf juice\n  > Aloe vera inner leaf juice is made by removing the rind prior to processing, either by machine or by hand, and then rinsing away the aloe latex. The remaining, gelatinous inner-leaf material is then ground/crushed into aloe vera inner leaf juice.\n\nIn some other countries Aloe vera juice is produced using the patented [TTS (Time, Temperature, Sanitation)][5] method.\n\nOnce Aloe vera gel is filtered out for consumption, then it's considered safe, because without filtration it can be harmful causing potential toxicity when swallowed. \n\nAloe vera that contains [aloin][6] (however it's not for sure) in excess amounts may induce side effects, but there is very little data about what levels of aloin are in most liquid products (according to one research, it's less than 1ppm), however in solid/semi-solid products it could be 10-100 times higher.  If aloin is the cause of the tumors in rats, then the lower the concentration of aloin, then it's less harmful. However more research is needed to answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n### Is Aloe vera regulated?\n\nIn US Aloe vera is a dietary supplement and it's not regulated drug, so there is no guarantee of strength, purity, or safety of these products. Currently Aloe vera is approved by FDA as a food addictive for flavor.\n\nIn the UK, European Union, China, and Korea content and purity of Aloe is regulated by [IASC][7] (International Aloe Science Council Seal of Approval) which established standards to define what is (and what is not) \"aloe vera\" in finished products. The IASC standard states that only products containing acemannan, or the beta 1-4 acetylated glucomannans, can be accurately labeled as aloe vera. Acemannan is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is present in aloe vera and is used as an identifier of the botanical by analytical means. Products that do not contain acemannan are not considered to be true aloe vera based on this standard.\n\n\n### How can I tell if a product truly contains Aloe vera?\n\nIn countries where Aloe vera is regulated, you should check the label for seal-based certification (see: [labeling guidance][8]). You may also check the [certified products list on IASC website][9]. Also make sure that [Aloin][10] content has been removed.\n\n### Health benefits\n\nPotential health benefits of drinking Aloe vera juice includes:\n\n- support the digestive system and relieve constipation,\n\n  For example mixing Aloe with different oils and lemon juice can reach the entire gastrointestinal track to the colon.

There is considerable variability in the result\n\n> RESULTS\u2014The slope (95% CI) for mean sensor glucose concentration (area under the curve)\nversus a centrally measured HbA1c was 24.4 mg/dL (22.0\u201326.7) for each 1% change in HbA1c,\nwith an intercept of 216.2 mg/dL (232.9 to 0.6). Although the slope did not vary with age or\nsex, there was substantial individual variability, with mean sensor glucose concentrations ranging from 128 to 187 mg/dL for an HbA1c of 6.9\u20137.1%. The root mean square of the errors\nbetween the actual mean sensor glucose concentration versus the value calculated using the\nregression equation was 14.3 mg/dL, whereas the median absolute difference was 10.1 mg/dL\n\nThe test measures how much hemoglobin becomes glycosalated which means that how many glucose molecules attach to the hemoglobin molecule.  The amount of hemoglobin around depends on the number of red cells, and the number of red cells depends on the red cell life, their production and destruction.   Some conditions shorten the life of a red cell from the average of 120 days but in sickle cell disease it can drop to 28 days\n\nAs red cells age they accumulate more glycosalated hemoglobin so conditions which shorten red cell life span would tend to lower the HbA1c\n\n> Blood HbA1c is a mean for RBCs with values that range from very low for reticulocytes to approximately twice the mean for the oldest RBCs.\n\nWe also see that diabetic patients can have RBCs with shorter lives\n\n> The mean age of circulating RBCs ranged from 39 to 56 days in diabetic subjects and 38 to 60 days in nondiabetic controls\n\nbut anemia, and even exercise can shorten the life of a red cell\n\n> Exercise and professional sport increase RBC turnover and maximize oxygen delivery to the tissues (Mairb\u00e4url, 2013). Maturation and aging of RBCs is accompanied by multiple processes occurring at various rates driving the circulating RBCs from adolescence to senescence within approximately 120 days (Lew and Tiffert, 2013; Lutz and Bogdanova, 2013). The resulting \u201cmarkers of senescence\u201d are recognized by the macrophages and clearance of RBCs is promptly initiated (de Back et al., 2014). Premature clearance is a hallmark of various disorders associated with anemia. In each case one or multiple markers of senescence appear prematurely. Those include excessive oxidative stress (Mohanty et al., 2014), excessive cation leak with the following dehydration (Wang et al., 2014), decrease in RBC size and loss of RBC membrane through vesiculation (Alaarg et al., 2013), metabolic abnormalities (Vives-Corrons et al., 2013), or following auto-immune diseases (Lutz and Bogdanova, 2013). Blood storage damages RBCs facilitating aging. As a result clearance of transfused cells is dramatically facilitated (Bosman, 2013; Flatt et al., 2014).\n\nWith normal activity, and no other health conditions that affect red cell life, one can expect the HbA1c to apply over a period of 115 days +/- 15% which is the average life span of red cells.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WYlgSDa.png)\n\nhttps://ashpublications.org/blood/article/45/2/273/160155/Red-cell-life-span-in-sickle-cell-hemoglobin-C\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581997/\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00269/full", "22855": "It's not a given, that they are not useful in solid tumors (also lymphoma are accounted among the solid tumors).\n\nThere are pyrimidine-like antimetabolites, e. g. 5-FU: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil, while some *purine* antimetabolites were in development, see e. g. here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4066218.\n\nThere are some approaches that try to make tumors more sensitive to purine antimetabolites, e. g. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295219304691.\n\nAnother, older, paper that describes a purine antimetabolite in lymphoma: https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.1991.9.1.175\n\nA more recent approach on the purine metabolism: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01697/full", "21574": "Hyperoxygenation causes vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance.

Noted Heredia, \"[W]e found serving meals rich in probiotics with fried tomato sauce boosts its probiotic effect, as well as causing a progressive isomerization of the lycopene of the tomato, from form cis to trans throughout digestion, which positively results in an increased final bioaccessibility of this carotenoid.\"  \n\u2014 [Cooking Tomatoes Increases Lycopene and Beneficial Bacteria](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/06/04/cooked-tomatoes.aspx)\n\nOther studies have shown that *how* food is cooked also has a significant effect:\n\n>We conclude that the addition of olive oil to diced tomatoes during cooking greatly increases the absorption of lycopene.

By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 \u2248 2.07%.\n\n(The [tracker](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a CFR of 427 / 20679 \u2248 2.06%.)\n\n<sup>\\*) As a theoretical definition of the mortality rate _in the long run_, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense.  But then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.</sup>\n\n----\n\nTo compare this with your definition of \"mortality rate\" (as *N*<sub>d</sub> /  (*N*<sub>d</sub> + *N*<sub>r</sub>), where *N*<sub>r</sub> is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease), we need to start by observing that there's no single universal and unambiguous definition of what \"recovering from a disease\" means.  Commonly used definitions tend to be something like \"no symptoms for *X* days\" and/or \"viral load below *N* particles per mL for *X* days\" or simply \"whenever a doctor declares that you're healthy again and lets you out of the hospital\".\n\nNow, let's say that we're using a (somewhat) objective definition of recovery like \"no detectable symptoms for two days\".  The first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100% simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  (That is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection; otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.)\n\nFurther, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the \"true\" long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing.  This is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.\n\n----\n\nFor an illustrative example, let's consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1% long-term average CFR \u2014 that is to say, exactly 1% of all (recognizably) infected patients will die of the disease.  Let's further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur.  After this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days.  As remission is possible (but rare), doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days.  Thus, a typical case would progress as follows:\n\n> onset of symptoms \u2192 increasing symptoms (2 days) \u2192 peak severity \u2192 declining symptoms (3 days) \u2192 no symptoms \u2192 observation (2 days) \u2192 officially recovered (total time: approx. 7 days from onset)\n\nor, for the 1% of patients for whom the disease is fatal:\n\n> onset of symptoms \u2192 increasing symptoms (2 days) \u2192 death (total time: approx. 2 days from onset)\n\nNow, let's assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days.  Thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows (assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1%, rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later):\n\n        |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  \n    day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |\n    ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+\n      1 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      2 |     2 |     3 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      3 |     5 |     8 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      4 |    10 |    18 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      5 |    20 |    38 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      6 |    50 |    88 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      7 |   100 |   188 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n      8 |   200 |   388 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |       0.0% |\n      9 |   500 |   888 |     2 |     3 |     1 |     1 |   0.11% |      25.0% |\n     10 |  1000 |  1888 |     5 |     8 |     2 |     3 |   0.16% |      27.3% |\n     11 |  2000 |  3888 |    10 |    18 |     5 |     8 |   0.21% |      30.8% |\n     12 |  5000 |  8888 |    20 |    38 |    10 |    18 |   0.20% |      32.1% |\n\n\nAs you can see from the table above, na\u00efvely calculating the case fatality rate as (total number of deaths) / (total number of cases) during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term CFR by a factor of (in this case) about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death.  On the other hand, using your formula of (total deaths) / (total deaths + recovered) would _overestimate_ the true CFR by a factor of about 30!\n\nMeanwhile, let's assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day.  Now the total numbers will look like this:\n\n        |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  \n    day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |\n    ----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+\n     13 | 10000 | 18888 |    50 |    88 |    20 |    38 |   0.20% |      30.2% |\n     14 | 10000 | 28888 |    99 |   187 |    50 |    88 |   0.30% |      32.0% |\n     15 | 10000 | 38888 |   198 |   385 |   100 |   188 |   0.48% |      32.8% |\n     16 | 10000 | 48888 |   495 |   880 |   100 |   288 |   0.59% |      24.7% |\n     17 | 10000 | 58888 |   990 |  1870 |   100 |   388 |   0.66% |      17.2% |\n     18 | 10000 | 68888 |  1980 |  3850 |   100 |   488 |   0.71% |      11.2% |\n     19 | 10000 | 78888 |  4950 |  8800 |   100 |   588 |   0.74% |       6.3% |\n     20 | 10000 | 88888 |  9900 | 18700 |   100 |   688 |   0.77% |       3.5% |\n     21 | 10000 | 98888 |  9900 | 28600 |   100 |   788 |   0.80% |       2.7% |\n\nAs you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down.  In fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the \"true\" long-term case fatality rate of 1%.  But by then, the epidemic will be basically over.\n\nThere are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic.  One such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time.  For our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the CFR by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths _within that cohort_ by the total number of patients in the cohort.  Furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value.\n\nUnfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-nCov would require more detailed information than the tracker you've linked to provides.  Even the [time series spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UF2pSkFTURko2OvfHWWlFpDFAr1UxCBA4JLwlSP6KFo/edit?usp=sharing) the tracker links to doesn't directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum:** A few preliminary cohort studies of the kind I describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-nCoV.\n\nIn particular, [\"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern\"](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9) by Wang _et al._ and [\"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\"](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5) by Huang _et al._, both published on January 24 in _The Lancet_, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV before Jan 2, 2020 in Wuhan, six had died (and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized) by Jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6% in this cohort.\n\nHowever, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons (besides just the small number of cases examined) why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term CFR:\n\n> \"*However, both of these* [CFR] *estimates* [of 14.6% from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9% from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing] *should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.*\"\n\nThere's also a later paper titled [\"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\"](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7) by Chen _et al._, published on Jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between Jan 1 to Jan 20 and reports a CFR of 11% within this cohort.  However, the study only followed these patients up to Jan 25, by which time more than half of them (57 out of 99) still remained hospitalized.", "20676": "Healthy kidneys practically completely excrete [creatinine][1], which means it is not reabsorbed in the kidneys. In kidney damage, less blood is filtered by the kidneys (decreased glomerular filtration), which means less creatinine is excreted, so it accumulates in the blood. So, creatinine excretion is not \"impaired\" but slowed down because of decreased blood flow through the kidneys.\n\nIn a healthy person, glucose glucose and proteins are not excreted into the urine in significant amounts. In kidney damage, there is increased permeability of glomerular capillary wall and decreased reabsorption of the proteins ([proteinuria][2]), so they can be excreted into the urine. Kidney disease only rarely results in the excretion of glucose into urine ([glycosuria][3]).\n\nWhen blood glucose levels exceed \"plasma glucose threshold,\" which is 180 mg/L (10 mmol/L), which is usually due to diabetes mellitus, some glucose will be excreted into the urine, even when the kidneys are not damaged ([Diabetes, 2011][4]).\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine\n  [2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815489495\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosuria\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3046828/", "20793": "### Summary\nTobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. All aminoglycoside antibiotics carry a risk of irreversible ototoxicity. The risk is reduced when applied topically, but not eliminated. Even topical use should be avoided for middle ear infections (otitis media). For external ear infections (otitis externa), care should be taken, including ensuring an intact tympanic membrane. As [this Canadian review suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4284193/), it is important to discuss the risk of ototoxicity with patients when making a treatment decision.\n\n### Approval and use in the US, Canada, and the UK\n\nThere are no approved formulations of tobramycin for any ear infection in the US, but there is a [suspension](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/060613s013lbl.pdf) containing neomycin that is approved for otitis externa. It contains a warning:\n\n> WARNINGS: Neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss due to cochlear\ndamage, mainly destruction of hair cells in the organ of Corti. The risk is greater with prolonged\nuse. Therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days (see PRECAUTIONS-General). Patients\nbeing treated with eardrops containing neomycin should be under close clinical observation.\nCASPORYN HC Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic\nmembrane. \n\nTo summarize the main points: **Ototoxicity is a risk. Patients should be carefully observed. If the tympanic membrane is perforated, this drug is absolutely contraindicated.**\n\nGentamicin drops are approved [in Canada for otitis externa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3567906/), and are [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10401847/) to be used off label for otitis media.\n\nIn [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584651), aminoglycoside drops are described as first line therapy in the UK for chronic suppurative otitis media, much to the review authors' chagrin. \n\n\n### Background on aminoglycosides and ototoxicity\n\nAminoglycosides are generally reserved for severe infections (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis). This is, in part, due to the challenging side effect profile common to all members of this drug class, including irreversible ototoxicity, reported in up to 25% of patients in some series.  Ototoxicity appears to depend on [rapid uptake and slow elimination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8019890) by hair cells, which in turn depends on plasma concentration, but it is not predictable. Ototoxicity can occur after brief, low dose therapy, and may not manifest until after the drug has been withdrawn, with permanent disability resulting. As mentioned in the question, there are hereditary syndromes and certain genetic mutations that increase susceptibility, but ototoxicity can occur without them.  \n\n**In summary, ototoxicity is a common, irreversible, unpredictable, and severe side effect of aminoglycoside use.**\n\nGoodman & Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics provides a good overview of aminoglycosides, with a detailed section on ototoxicity.\n\n### Topical use doesn't eliminate systemic absorption\n\nTopical preparations of aminoglycosides are approved in the U.S. for certain eye and skin infections. Topical use reduces, but does not eliminate absorption and systemic distribution these antibiotics (Goodman & Gilman Ch. 54). This is not surprising, as infection and the associated inflammation compromise the barrier function of the skin. Absorption can be substantial in the presence of blistering or denuded skin. In the ear, specifically, while tympanic membrane perforation increases the risk of ototoxicity, [there is detectable absorption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9425487) [without perforation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10542926/). \n", "20587": "**There are several components to this question:**\n\n 1. Is hydrogen peroxide (as used in dental hygiene procedures) absorbed into the body in significant quantities?\n\n 2. Could absorbed hydrogen peroxide have systemic effects?\n\n 3. To what extent is oxidative stress a factor in the pathogenesis of vitiligo?\n\n 4. Can absorbed hydrogen peroxide contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo due to an increase in oxidative stress?\n\nI will provide some evidence and discussion for each of these points below.\n   \n***\n\nBackground on [hydrogen peroxide][1] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)\n-----------------\n\nHydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen\u2013oxygen single bond). It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry. Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond.\n\n[![Hydrogen peroxide formula][2]][2]\n\n***\n\n1: Use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in dentistry\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[This paper][3] is a review of the use of hydrogen peroxide in dentistry. \n\nThe levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in toothpastes and dentifrices are generally much lower than those used for teeth whitening or bleaching.\n\n> Studies in which 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or less were used daily for up to 6 years\n> showed occasional transitory irritant effects only in a small number\n> of subjects with preexisting ulceration, or when high levels of salt\n> solutions were concurrently administered. \n>\n> In contrast, bleaching\n> agents that employ or generate high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  or organic\n> peroxides can produce localized oral toxicity following sustained\n> exposure if mishandled.\n\nThey note potential health concerns raised by animal studies.\n\n> From a single study using the hamster cheek pouch model, 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was\n> referred to as a cocarcinogen in the oral mucosa. This (and later)\n> studies have shown that at 3% or less, no cocarcinogenic activity or\n> adverse effects were observed in the hamster cheek pouch following\n> lengthy exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.\n\nSo concentrations below 3% seem unlikely to cause significant harm. Beneficial effects (such as improvement in gingival disease and promoting healing due to an antimicrobial effect) are seen at concentrations above 1%.\n\nBased on this, a window of 1-3% concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would appear to be optimal.\n\n***\n\nA UK government [toxicological report][4] confirms that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only causes local toxicity by irritation and cellular damage, but it does not cause systemic problems and is not considered a carcinogen.\n\n***\n\n2: Metabolism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\n----------------------------------------\n\nH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a byproduct of many biochemical reactions and is toxic to cells. The enzyme [catalase][5] is found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals). It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are also known as *free radicals*.\n\nThe reaction is shown below.\n\n[![Breakdown of hydrogen peroxide][6]][6]\n\n> The toxicity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is due to oxidation of proteins, membrane lipids\n> and DNA by the peroxide ions. The class of biological enzymes called\n> superoxide dismutase (SOD) is developed in nearly all living cells as\n> an important antioxidant agent. They promote the disproportionation of\n> superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then rapidly\n> decomposed by catalase to oxygen and water.\n\n\n**What is oxidation?**\n\nOxidation is one of a pair of opposite chemical reactions involving transfer of electrons; oxidation and reduction. Together they are known as [redox][7] reactions.\n\n*Oxidation* is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.\n\n*Reduction* is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.\n\nIn a redox reaction, one component is oxidised and the other reduced.\n\n> For example, during the combustion of wood, electrons are transferred\n> from carbon atoms in the wood to oxygen atoms in the air. The oxygen\n> atoms undergo reduction, gaining electrons, while the carbon atoms\n> undergo oxidation, losing electrons. Thus oxygen is the oxidizing\n> agent and carbon is the reducing agent in this reaction.\n\nAnother example of a redox reaction is the oxidation of glucose to release energy in [cellular respiration][8].\n\nCatalase uses the oxidising power of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to oxidise other potentially harmful substrates that need to be broken down (like phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol), while the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself is reduced in the process. This is called the peroxidation reaction.\n\nCatalase is present in all cells (especially the liver and kidneys). Apart from local tissue destruction, small amounts that might be absorbed would be broken down in this manner.\n\n***\n\n3: [Vitiligo][9]\n--------\n\nVitiligo is a condition in which melanocytes in patches of skin cease production of the pigment melanin.\n\nThere are several theories about its pathogenesis. It is associated with certain genetic susceptibility markers and also with other autoimmune disorders, suggesting an autoimmune process. The autoantigen is likely to be the tyrosinase enzyme, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis.\n\n**Oxidative stress theory**\n\n[This research paper][10] discusses oxidative stress in the context of vitiligo.\n\n> In vitiligo, melanocytes are particularly vulnerable to oxidative\n> stress owing to the pro-oxidant state generated during melanin\n> synthesis and to the genetic antioxidant defects.\n\nIn particular, with relevance to catalase:\n\n> In both lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo patients, increased\n> levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed, accompanied\n> with reduced levels and activity of catalase.\n>\n> It is well known that normal melanocytes are vulnerable to excessive\n> reactive oxygen species (ROS) for their specialized function of melanin synthesis, which would\n> result in a highly pro-oxidant state in the epidermis.\n>\n> This imbalance between the pro-oxidants and the antioxidant status can\n> disrupt the homeostasis of melanocytes, causing accumulation of\n> oxidized and damaged proteins or organelles, and consequently lead to\n> the destruction of melanocytes.\n\nSo there is evidence of increased oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, it is a complex picture, with probable environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility factors. An autoimmune process and oxidative stress are not mutually exclusive, as the former could disable the cellular mechanisms for dealing with the latter.\n\n***\n\n4: Can absorbed hydrogen peroxide contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo due to an increase in oxidative stress?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEssentially, assimilating this information, the answer seems to be no.\n\nApplied hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) primarily causes local irritation and tissue damage, depending on the concentration. It is not significantly absorbed and small absorbed amounts would be quickly broken down by catalase.\n\nWhile increased susceptibility to oxidative stress in melanocytes plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, it is a disruption of the cellular mechanisms for managing oxidative stress, rather than a primary increase of oxidants (like hydrogen peroxide) that is the main factor.\n\n  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XU0sY.jpg\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7500245/\n  [4]: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/337708/Hydrogen_Peroxide_Toxicological_Overview_phe_v1.pdf\n  [5]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hK1ES.jpg\n  [7]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox\n  [8]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration\n  [9]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo\n  [10]: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42394", "20338": "The approach you describe most likely will not work, and could be detrimental to your training.\n\nThe main benefit of training at altitude is that the body will adapt to the lower concentration of oxygen by stimulating the production of erythropoietin which in turn causes the body to produce more red blood cells.\n\nWhat you are describing is a very limited version of intermittent hypoxic training (IHT). In subelite athletes, [this has been shown][1] to have some effect, however it was 60 minutes of training using a protocol of 3-5 minutes of hypoxia followed by the same amount of time of normoxia (normal breathing). (Also [cited here][2].)\n\n> In a study of male subelite competitive cyclists and triathletes, athletes were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (artificial brief intermittent LHTL) for 15 days over 3 weeks for 60\u2009min per day with either 3 or 5\u2009min periods of hypoxia followed by the same duration in normoxia. Cycling performance improved during incremental step exercise, including increases of 4.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1% in peak aerobic power, 4.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0% in lactate profile power, and 6.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3% in heart rate profile power compared to control measured 3 days post-intervention.35 Fourteen days after treatment, differences between the hypoxia groups were unclear, suggesting that intermittent hypoxia training should be timed for competitive events to take place within a few days following treatment. In a similar study, performance did not improve among elite athletes,36 suggesting that artificial brief intermittent LHTL should be considered mainly by subelite athletes.\n\nThe most common method of attempting to achieve this is a training mask, which restricts air flow. Most studies ([like this one][3]) reject the claim that it helps by actually simulating altitude, but they do note that it helps train the respiratory muscles and may help improve lung usage.\n\nThe short period that you describe really won't have enough of an impact on the body to stimulate altitude related changes in blood and plasma.\n\n\n  [1]: https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/4/1/article-p68.xml\n  [2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254615000836#bib0180\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879455/", "20262": "This is how exposure to cold can result in heart attack:\n\n - Cold triggers the release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which results in constriction of blood vessels in the skin and thus in an **increase of blood pressure.**\n - The heart needs to work harder to pump blood against the increased blood pressure, so it **uses more oxygen.**\n - In individuals with coronary atherosclerosis, the limited blood flow may not be able to deliver enough oxygen to meet increased heart oxygen demand, which results in pain (angina pectoris) or in **ischemic damage of the heart muscle (myocardial infarction).** \n\nThe study below has shown that the described mechanism is harmful only for \"cold-intolerant\" patients with prolonged high blood pressure response, while in \"cold-tolerant\" patients, the heart rate can quickly decrease and thus normalize the blood pressure. \n\n[Mechanisms of cold intolerances in patients with angina (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 1994)][1]:\n\n> Seven cold-intolerant and seven cold-tolerant patients with angina\n> underwent exercise treadmill testing at 6 and 25 \u00b0C with measurement\n> of catecholamines.

Specifically, there is growing evidence that supports maternal immune dysfunction **may** underlie the behavioral abnormalities observed **in a subset of children affected with the disorder**(8). Several immunologic risk factors have been described including: genetic associations with immune-related genes(9\u201316), family history of autoimmune disease(15, 17\u201321), maternal inflammation and infection during pregnancy(22\u201327), and altered immune responses in the children, and are associated with increased impairments in core and associated features of ASD(28). More specific to this review, maternal anti-brain autoantibodies, which are thought to access the fetal compartment during gestation, have been identified as one risk factor for developing ASD and are proposed to contribute to early neurodevelopmental perturbations in the developing fetus(29\u201331).\n>\nReferences\n>\n 3.

Further, there is now an abundance of evidence supporting their deleterious role in neurodevelopment. For the most part, these studies have described similar experimental outcomes and, given the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD, there likely exists a complex relationship between the presence of maternal anti-fetal brain antibodies and developmental trajectory of exposed offspring. It is still unclear how and when these maternal autoantibodies arise, but studies currently underway may provide increased insight into their ontogeny.\n\n##Genes causing ASD \n\nThe [NHS webpage on Autism][2] states (Emphasis mine)\n\n> **Most researchers believe** that certain genes a child inherits from their parents could make them more vulnerable to developing ASD.\n\n> **Cases of ASD have been known to run in families**. For example, younger siblings of children with ASD can also develop the condition, and it's common for identical twins to both develop ASD.\n\n> **No specific genes linked to ASD have been identified**, but it may be a presenting feature of some rare genetic syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and [Angelman syndrome][3].\n\n##Environmental causes\n\nThe [NHS say][2] that\n\n> **Some researchers believe** that a person born with a genetic vulnerability to ASD only develops the condition if they're exposed to a specific environmental trigger.\n\n> **Possible triggers** include being born prematurely (before 35 weeks of pregnancy), or being exposed in the womb to alcohol or to certain medication, such as sodium valproate (sometimes used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy).\n\n> **No conclusive evidence has been found** linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD.\n\nResearch Autism has some referenced information on [leading research into the causes of Autism][4] from the Medical Research Council, National Autistic Society and the Autism Society of America; and the crux of the matter from what is said here is that the causes are still being investigated and\n\n> There is no known single cause for autism, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function\n\nThe site also provides a [list of publications on the **possible** causes of Autism][5]\n\n##References\n\nEdmiston, E., Ashwood, P., & Van de Water, J.

The damaged cells attract neutrophils, which, in the attempt to clean the mess, can cause further damage (more details in the [Journal of Hepatology][1] and in [this nice video][2]).\n\nAlcohol breakdown also results in an increase of NADH and depletion of NAD, which stimulates fatty acid synthesis. \n\nOn the **tissue level,** the stages of alcoholic liver damage are fat accumulation (steatosis), inflammation (hepatitis), cell death (necrosis) and conversion to fibrous tissue (fibrosis and cirrhosis).

It's important to note that these authors are from institutions in China, which may mean that their surgical technique is region-specific (and perhaps not allowed by regulatory agencies in the United States). Generally speaking, any type of SRS procedure you might receive from a qualified plastic surgeon will likely produce satisfying and relatively uncomplicated results. [[3](https://doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000002684)]\n\nResearchers in South Korea, another hotspot for plastic surgery, have published very favorable data on long-term results (in terms of anatomic and sexual function as well as patient satisfaction) on a minimally-invasive vaginoplasty that takes a laparoscopic rectosigmoid approach. [[4](https://doi.org/10.3109/2000656X.2011.613649)] Naturally, this procedure can have complications, as it involves dissection of the rectum, creating potential for gut flora to migrate into the peritoneum and neovagina. However, long-term studies (10 and 25 years) have shown the rectosigmoid approach to be \"useful, safe, and well-accepted\" without requiring a graft. [[5](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.PRS.0000066169.78208.D4),[6](https://doi.org/10.5999/aps.2017.44.1.48)] Again, this procedure is largely region-specific.\n\nFinally, you might consider that the \"additional use of full-thickness skin graft does not influence neovaginal shrinkage, nor does it affect the patient- and physician-reported aesthetic or functional outcome\" [[7](https://doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000003108)], so you'll likely be able to avoid having a graft if you explain your wishes to your surgeon. I can find at least one surgeon in the United States from cursory Googling [[8](https://drlschechter.com/penile-inversion-vaginoplasty/)] who mentions the optional nature of the graft: \"Occasionally, skin grafts are required in order to achieve adequate vaginal depth. Your consultation will determine whether or not a skin graft is necessary.\"\n\n", "19087": "In water intoxication, cells do not burst but swell. This can lead to swelling of the entire organs; the most dangerous is **brain swelling,** which is the usual cause of death.\n\nTransitional cell or organ swelling is not already a damage. Brain swelling is different because the swollen brain presses hardly against the skull, which can cause damage. \n\nWhen you drink excessive amounts of water and do not experience any symptoms within the next 24 hours, it is very unlikely that any permanent damage has occurred in your body.

This more likely happens if you:\n\n - are *already well hydrated* and drink excessive amount of water several hours in the row (so the kidneys have no time to excrete it)\n - *do not consume any sodium* from foods or beverages (but common commercial sport drinks, such as Gatorade, may not contain enough sodium to prevent hyponatremia)\n - *have low body weight* (children and women are at higher risk)\n - *exercise,* which, in some people, increases secretion of the antidiuretic hormone (which causes water retention)\n - *sweat only little*\n\nFrom the above reasons, the amount of water that causes water intoxication is not a fixed number.

No. Uterine involution, the return of the uterus to the nonpregnant state postpartum, does involve a remarkable decrease in size, but it's not as small as it was before pregnancy. Nonpregnant uterine size increases with what we call parity, or the number of times a woman has carried a pregnancy to term. I can't seem to find the original data on this, but it would likely be an early 20th century (or possibly late 19th) pathology series.

It is widely believed that use of a powered toothbrush, which employs a mechanical action instead of a manual action, reduces brushing force and the incidence of gingival bleeding because of gum damage. In a study by Danser et al., it was observed that brushing force was not influenced by the speed of the brush head and had no correlation with the incidence of gingival abrasion. In another study by Boyd et al., it was determined that power toothbrushes were used with about one-third the force of a manual toothbrush.\n\n> In a Swiss study evaluating the clinical effects and gingival abrasion aspects of two power toothbrushes and one manual toothbrush, it was determined that in a group of dental students trained in manual brushing technique, where efficacy was similar with the three toothbrushes tested, there was no evidence of greater gingival abrasion with either powered toothbrush when compared with a manual brush.\n\n\n\n> The concerns of gingival abrasion associated with tooth brushing are influenced by the filament end-rounding of the brush on either manual or power toothbrushes. The results of the Danser et al. study concluded that end rounding has no effect on plaque removal, but does affect the incidence of gingival abrasion. They showed that gingival abrasion is not influenced by brushing force, but is affected by filament end rounding.\n\n> [Catherine Penick: \"Power toothbrushes: a critical review\", Int J Dent Hygiene P, 2004; 40\u201344][5].

Vitamin D is either eaten in the food, [created with the help of sunlight][1] or [supplemented][2]. Many appear to net have enough it:\n\n\n> Humans get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, from their diet, and from dietary supplements. A diet high in oily fish prevents vitamin D deficiency. Solar ultraviolet B radiation (wavelength, 290 to 315 nm) penetrates the skin and converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, which is rapidly converted to vitamin D3. Because any excess previtamin D3 or vitamin D3 is destroyed by sunlight, excessive exposure to sunlight does not cause vitamin D3 intoxication.\nFew foods naturally contain or are fortified with vitamin D. The \u201cD\u201d represents D2 or D3. Vitamin D2 is manufactured through the ultraviolet irradiation of ergosterol from yeast, and vitamin D3 through the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin. Both are used in over-the-counter vitamin D supplements, but the form available by prescription in the United States is vitamin D2.   \n><sub>[Vitamin D deficiency, MF Holick - New England Journal of Medicine, 2007 - Mass Medical Soc][3]</sub>\n\nSince you are primarily interested in D-sunlight: \n\n[Pigmentation of the skin][4]: the amount of \"black\" people now living in Europe is rising. While that number is not significant for most cases often discussed, *all* of them (the more melanin the worse) have difficulty getting enough vitamin D from sunlight alone north of the 37th parallel.\n\n> [![enter image description here][5]][5]     \n> <sub>[From Harvard Women's Health Watch: Time for more vitamin D, 2008][6]</sub>\n\nWhy the 35th, 37th or 40th parallel? Because the angle of the sun enables the atmosphere to filter out much of the UV rays needed to synthesise vitamin D. That angle is also varying during the day!\n\nThe reference [Cancer Research UK. (2010). Vitamin D expert review][7] already states clearly:\n> The amount of UVB in sunlight changes substantially with season, latitude and time of day. These factors greatly affect vitamin D production, which is greatest around two hours either side of solar noon, and during summer months. \n\nMad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun? Many Europeans are around noon: in school, at work, in nursing homes -> indoors. Some cannot get out, others are not allowed to for different reasons.\n\nThose that do get out at the right time, in summer, around noon, are now scared into wearing hats and sunscreens for \"reasons\" (skin cancer, photoaging etc). The sun's rays have to reach the skin and penetrate it. For the right amount of time and with the right amount of intensity. The equation UVB equals bad leads to inadequate sun exposure and that to inadequate vitamin D synthesis. We have to choose our poison here and are currently opting for weaker bones (excuse the exaggeration).\n\nSome individuals in lower latitudes get enough sun for sure, and yet their vitamin D status is low:\n\n> [\"Low Vitamin D Status despite Abundant Sun Exposure\" N. Binkley et al., The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Volume 92, Issue 6, 1 June 2007, Pages 2130\u20132135][8], https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2006-2250\n> A probable explanation for the \u201clow\u201d 25(OH)D status of some individuals is found in their failure to obtain high circulating D3 concentrations. Possible explanations for this include inadequate cutaneous production of D3, enhanced cutaneous destruction of previtamin D3 or vitamin D3, down-regulation of cutaneous synthesis by sun-induced melanin production, or abnormalities of transport from the skin to the circulation.\n\n> <sub>From Wolfgang Herrmann and Rima Obeid (Eds): \"Vitamins in the prevention of human diseases\", 2011, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York:</sub>     \n> Cutaneously synthesized or orally ingested vitamin D is transported in the circulation bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP). In the blood, only a small fraction is present as free, unbound vitamin D metabolites. The 25-hydroxylation of both vitamin D2 or vitamin D3, is the initial step in vitamin D activation. This takes place primarily in the liver. [\u2026] Nevertheless, extra-hepatic sources of 25-hydroxylation have been described in humans as well. They include macrophages, fibroblasts, keratinocytes and arterial endothelial cells (Gascon-Barre, 2005). (p. 365)\n\nAnd there comes another factor into play: a trend to low animal derived nutrition or even veganism. You may eat a lot of liver and obtain all the vitamin D you need, and more, from that. Eating offal is on the decline and plant based nutrition is usually very low in vitamin D. \n\nAnd low in cholesterol as well!\n\n> There are no reports of vitamin D intoxication in healthy adults after intensive sunlight exposure. Vitamin D in the skin reaches a plateau after only 15\u201330 min of UVB exposure. Then, vitamin D-inactive substances such as lumisterol and tachysterol are produced, which do not reach the systemic circulation. (p. 367)\nThat means that only a small amount is available:\n\n> **Its precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol** in the plasma membranes of both epidermal basal and suprabasal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts is converted to previtamin D3. Cutaneously synthesized vitamin D3 is released from the plasma membrane and enters the systemic circulation bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) [\u2026] Factors influencing vitamin D levels Nutrient deficiencies are usually the result of dietary inadequacy, impaired absorption and use, increased requirement, or increased excretion. Vitamin D deficiency can occur when usual intake is lower than recommended levels over time, exposure to sunlight is limited, the kidneys cannot convert 25(OH)D to its active form, or absorption of vitamin D from the digestive tract is inadequate. Vitamin D-deficient diets are associated with milk allergy, lactose intolerance, ovo-vegetarianism, and veganism. Regarding the amount of vitamin D production in human skin, it depends on several variables including environmental factors such as geographic latitude, season, time of day, weather conditions (cloudiness), amount of air pollution and surface reflection which can all interfere with the amount of UVB radiation reaching the skin [\u2026] The skin is unique in being not only the source of vitamin D for the body but also in being capable of responding to the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D. Both 1,25(OH)2D and its receptor (VDR) play essential roles in the skin.     \n<sub>From: [Vitamin D and the skin: Focus on a complex relationship: A review][9] 2015.</sub> \n\n\nWhile cholesterol is easily synthesised by humans, its presence in the blood is equally equated with bad! Low cholesterol and low synthesis of vitamin D are [plain][10] to see and taking drugs [interfering][11] with cholesterol metabolism \u2013 or eating cholesterol lowering food (more fibre  please!) \u2013 might influence vitamin D synthesis. These relations are [currently][12] [contested][13] in heated debates with [differing][14] views.\n\nIf a citizen is obese, and those are said to increase in number and weight:\n> [Andjela T. Drincic: \"Volumetric Dilution, Rather Than Sequestration Best Explains the Low Vitamin D Status of Obesity\"][15] 2012 https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.404 \n\nAs one review summarised it:\n> **Results**    \n> The definition of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, as well as assay methodology for 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D, vary between studies. However, serum 25(OH)D levels below 75 nmol/L are prevalent in every region studied whilst levels below 25 nmol/L are most common in regions such as South Asia and the Middle East. Older age, female sex, higher latitude, winter season, darker skin pigmentation, less sunlight exposure, dietary habits, and absence of vitamin D fortification are the main factors that are significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D levels.    \n> <sub>[A.

When the analysis was limited to fish-based or plant-based, dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats there was still no evidence of reduction in deaths or cardiovascular events in any group.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Fish oil is not just a magic pill that is equally beneficial for anyone in every circumstance. And as so often \"taking much will do much good\" does simply not apply.\n\nWhy is this the case?

But it is inappropriate to grab every one such study and start selling stuff based on these findings:\n\n\n> [Estimated macronutrient and fatty acid intakes from an East African Paleolithic diet:][10]<br>      \nOur genome adapts slowly to changing conditions of existence. Many diseases of civilisation result from mismatches between our Paleolithic genome and the rapidly changing environment, including our diet. The objective of the present study was to reconstruct multiple Paleolithic diets to estimate the ranges of nutrient intakes upon which humanity evolved. A database of, predominantly East African, plant and animal foods (meat/fish) was used to model multiple Paleolithic diets, using two pathophysiological constraints (i.e. protein < 35 energy % (en%) and linoleic acid (LA) >1\u00b70 en%), at known hunter\u2013gatherer plant/animal food intake ratios (range 70/30\u201330/70 en%/en%). We investigated selective and non-selective savannah, savannah/aquatic and aquatic hunter\u2013gatherer/scavenger foraging strategies. We found (range of medians in en%) intakes of moderate-to-high protein (25\u201329), moderate-to-high fat (30\u201339) and moderate carbohydrates (39\u201340). The fatty acid composition was SFA (11\u00b74\u201312\u00b70), MUFA (5\u00b76\u201318\u00b75) and PUFA (8\u00b76\u201315\u00b72). The latter was high in \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) (3\u00b77\u20134\u00b77 en%), low in LA (2\u00b73\u20133\u00b76 en%), and high in long-chain PUFA (LCP; 4\u00b775\u201325\u00b78 g/d), LCP n-3 (2\u00b726\u201317\u00b70 g/d), LCP n-6 (2\u00b754\u20138\u00b784 g/d), ALA/LA ratio (1\u00b712\u20131\u00b764 g/g) and LCP n-3/LCP n-6 ratio (0\u00b784\u20131\u00b792 g/g). Consistent with the wide range of employed variables, nutrient intakes showed wide ranges. We conclude that compared with Western diets, Paleolithic diets contained consistently higher protein and LCP, and lower LA. These are likely to contribute to the known beneficial effects of Paleolithic-like diets, e.g. through increased satiety/satiation. Disparities between Paleolithic, contemporary and recommended intakes might be important factors underlying the aetiology of common Western diseases. Data on Paleolithic diets and lifestyle, rather than the investigation of single nutrients, might be useful for the rational design of clinical trials. [\u2026]<br>    \n> The fish oil fatty acids EPA and DHA (and their derivatives), vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and vitamin A (retinoic acid) are examples of nutrients that act in concert, while each of these has multiple actions(7,8).\n>\n> Consequently, the criteria for establishing optimum nutrient intakes via randomised controlled trials (RCT) with single nutrients at a given dose and with a single end point have serious limitations. They are usually based upon poorly researched dose\u2013response relationships, and typically ignore many possible nutrient interactions and metabolic interrelationships.\n>\n> For instance, the adequate intake of linoleic acid (LA) to prevent LA deficiency depends on the concurrent intakes of \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), \u03b3-LA and arachidonic acid (AA). Consequently, the nutritional balance on which our genome evolved is virtually impossible to determine using the reigning paradigm of \u2018evidence-based medicine\u2019 with RCT.\n\n\nThe last sentence is a bit extreme in its wording but highlights very well the almost fraudulent 'jumping onto a soap box' attitude that the supplement industry apparently cannot resist since its creation.\n\nThe [German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment][11] reached in 2009 the point to issues [a warning and called for a maximum dosage of around 1-2g daily equivalent of 100g salmon][4]. Overdosing on these *pharmakons* would increase multiple risks, like increased bleeding, decreased immune system function, premature death for patients with pre-existing heart disease etc.\n\nGiving one single number to avoid overdoing it seems more than difficult. In this case it is not only the total dose response relationship to consider. This also about the ratio (mainly of fatty acids) and unavoidable interactions with other supplements, medications and normal food, which is now also sometimes fortified. As a general rule of thumb: consider an Inuit or Japanese gut and body, trained or habituated to large amounts of sea fish, whose owner also *really* likes eating fish. The equivalent amount of fish oil in supplements might be a good orientation for staying in the 'not detrimental' range. \n\nThere is no reason to abstain from fish. There is no doubt we do not eat enough omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 *compared to the ratio of omega 6.* Just [lowering omega-6 PUFAs][12] seems to be a much safer and cheaper way to achieve what the extolers want to achieve. Staying away from the industry's omega-6 rich food abolishes the perceived or real need for the industry's supplements? \n\nThis is not to say that (even supplemented) [omega-3][13], whether from fish oil or [from][14] [elsewhere][15] is totally useless, ineffective or wholly dangerous. In a clinical setting under good supervision and control of the individual and his lab results even high doses of fish oil will likely prove to be of substantial value in a wide range of applications. Everyone should be able to decide this for himself. But the industry has to be kept under the strictest regulation and harshly enforced quality control. The primary target for improving health has to be a sensible [diet][16].

[What][18] today is sold as \"health-food\" was once one of the very sparse reasons for ordinary [Germans to riot][19] and rebel and make a revolution!\n\n\n# The [conversion rate][20] for EPA and DHA is [usually low][21] but not necessarily too low\n\n[If fed much omega-3 the conversion rate in rats can exceed the brain's uptake limit.][22] And in humans this is quite similar.\n\n\n> The conversion efficiency of ALA to EPA varies between 0.2% and 21%, and that of ALA to DHA varies between 0% and 9% (Andrew et al. 2006; Williams and Burdge 2006). The conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is affected by multiple factors such as sex and competitive inhibition of \u03946-desaturase by LA and ALA. [\u2026]\n> **Besides the amount of PUFA, the ratio of \u03c96/\u03c93 is known to be of nutritional importance as it is the key index for balanced synthesis of eicosanoids in the body** (Steffens 1997). For optimal infant nutrition, the ratio of n-6/n-3 must be not higher than 10 (Gerster 1998). In Coastal states where mothers consumed high amounts of fish rich in n-3 PUFA, n-6/n-3 ratios were significantly lower than that of other countries (6.5 and 8.5, respectively) (Kneebone et al. 1985; Boersma et al. 1991). High consumption of plant oils rich in n-6 PUFA and consumption of relatively low marine foods (as source of n-3 PUFA) increases the n-6/n-3 ratio. When one has a diet rich in ALA and lower LA consumption levels, EPA and DHA in muscle tissue increased due to reduced competition for \u03946 desaturase. In most Indian consumers, the n-6/n-3 intake ratio is equal to 1/30-70, but the ideal ratio is 1/5-10 to protect human health. Japanese are the only people who take an ideal ratio of 1/2-4 and this is due to their consumption of seafood (Aleksandra et al. 2009). In communities in the west, consumption of \u03c96 is much higher than that of \u03c93; such that in the United States, consumption of \u03c96 is 10\u201330 times more than that of \u03c93. Nutritional scientists suggest the 2:1 to 4:1 n-6/n-3 ratio, which indicates a high consumption of seafood (Aleksandra et al. 2009).\n> From: [Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid sources and evaluation of their nutritional and functional properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237475/)\n\n\nThis is partially illustrated here:\n[![eicosanoid synthesing pathways.][23]][23]\n\nAs you can see, both pathways use the same enzymes, making them the limiting factor:\n\n> More specifically, most studies in humans have shown that whereas a certain, though restricted, conversion of high doses of ALA to EPA occurs, conversion to DHA is severely restricted. The use of ALA labelled with radioisotopes suggested that with a background diet high in saturated fat conversion to long-chain metabolites is approximately 6% for EPA and 3.8% for DHA. **With a diet rich in n-6 PUFA, conversion is reduced by 40 to 50%.** It is thus reasonable to observe an n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio not exceeding 4-6. From: [Can adults adequately convert alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3)?][24]\n>\n> [Omega-3: ALA intakes enough for EPA/DPA levels for non-fish eaters?<br>\nThe conversion of the plant-based omega-3 ALA to the long-chain EPA and DHA may be increased in vegans and vegetarians who do not eat fish, suggest results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).][25]\n\n\nSo while it is true that artificial transfats are really bad, and otherwise industrially damaged fats should be avoided at all cost it is not true that saturated fats have a bad influence on eicosanoid status. \nTotal consumption of plant based alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) is one key, over abundance of [omega-6][26] acids like arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) is another. That is quite ironic because a vegetarian or vegan diet that is not well planned tends to increase this unhealthy ratio of fatty acids. \n\n\nWhile the view that the ratio of all [fatty acids to one another][27] has come under attack, the rate of conversion is still dependent on dietary ALA in this view:\n> [Conversion of \u03b1-linolenic acid in humans is influenced by the absolute amounts of \u03b1-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in the diet and not by their ratio][28]\n\nToo much PUFAs of the wrong kind is detrimental.\n\nBeef from cows that are [grass fed tends][29] to be [a much richer source of omega-3 acids][30] than those fed soy and maize to fatten [them and us up][31]. \n\nIf you look at these sources of [essential fatty acids][32]:\n\n[![Pauling illustration of EFAs and sources][33]][33]\n\nApart from leaving out sources of good fat, like the nutritious monkey brain that's full of DHA because that [ape ate all][34] the good stuff away from us: You see an important ingredient in our diet suspiciously absent from that picture. The same article, however, does list it partially elsewhere:\n\n    Food Sources of Linoleic Acid (18:2n-6) (157)\n    Food                         Serving         Linoleic Acid (g)\n    Safflower oil                1 tablespoon    10.1\n    Sunflower seeds, oil roasted 1 oz            9.7\n    Pine nuts                    1 oz            9.4\n    Sunflower oil                1 tablespoon    8.9\n    Corn oil                     1 tablespoon    7.3\n    Soybean oil                  1 tablespoon    6.9\n    Pecans, oil roasted          1 oz            6.4\n    Brazil nuts                  1 oz            5.8\n    Sesame oil                   1 tablespoon    5.6\n\nSunflower-fat and oils from grains are a major contributor of PUFAs in a suboptimal ratio, providing too much [AA][35] and LA. And this is one part of refining fat: feeding animals the wrong kind of fodder that then ends up damaging us. Only eating the plants with this ratio directly might be even more damaging. A vegan cooking his gluten-rich seitan-steak in sunflower oil is very likely on the wrong track.\n\nThat means from an evolutionary view it is perfectly [reasonable][36] to [assume][37] that [humans evolved to eat what was/is found in the African savannah far from the coast][38]. Only after the neolithic revolution when our [western diet slowly][39] came into the abysmal shape it is today did we decrease our ability to synthesise EPA and DHA so much that adding external i.e. marine sources for them is now [almost][40] mandatory. If one wants to keep the high amount of omega6 in the diet.\n\n\nParts of the reasoning in the question are perfectly valid. But the unqualified call for poly-unsaturated essential fatty acids is the [culprit][41]. Mono-unsaturated acids and saturated fats might raise concerns because of their energy density, not because of their effect on DHA/EPA conversion. While omega-6 acids *are* necessary, they have been present in western diets in much to [high ratios][42]. It is therefore unwise to call for an increase in all PUFAs across the board.\nIt is not the use of cooking oil per se that brought us into this situation. It is industrialised agriculture and food preparation that favoured the very [lopsided][43] narrowing of our meal plans into the unhealthy category for way too many people.\n\n\n> 1. Limit total fat intake, avoid trans fatty acids, and reduce saturated fats.\n> 2. Make monounsaturated fatty acids the primary dietary fat\n> 3. Include good sources of ALA (omega-3 fatty acids from plants) daily.\n> 4. Reduce intake of omega-6 fatty acids, if excessive.\n> 5.

On the other hand this is indeed a public health issue very much unfocused by the public eye.\n\nOne additional problem not mentioned in the question is that from all the donated equipment some is not suitable, beyond repair, unwanted, without operators or technicians to repair, running out of replacement parts and consumables. That means that it is not only a factor of \"what percentage becomes operational\", but also of what arrives where, who profits from what along the whole line and how long does it stay operational?\n\n\nTo give you a few examples with references:\n[Effectiveness of medical equipment donations to improve health systems: how much medical equipment is broken in the developing world?][1]\n\n> It is often said that most of the medical equipment in the developing world is broken with estimates ranging up to 96% out of service. [\u2026] This study examined 112,040 pieces of equipment. An average of 38.3% (42,925, range across countries: 0.83\u201347%) in developing countries was out of service. The three main causes were lack of training, health technology management, and infrastructure. We hope that the findings will help biomedical engineers with their efforts toward effective designs for the developing world and NGO\u2019s with efforts to design effective healthcare interventions. [\u2026]<br>\nThe analysis may underestimate the number of pieces out of service. We have relied on hospital reported equipment status reports to create the analysis. However, hospitals may ignore some working equipment that never entered their inventory, broken equipment off inventory or they may lack the technical staff to conduct a thorough inventory. In any case, we suspect that many hospitals are underreporting their broken equipment. Unfortunately, we are aware of no independent, peer-reviewed study that tracks a particular shipment of donated equipment from original status to final disposition.\n\n> So, how much equipment is out of service in the developing world? The answer is about 40%. We find no evidence to support the statement that most or nearly all the equipment in resource poor settings is broken.\n\n> While donations can cause problems and there are undoubtedly some hospitals where the situation is much worse, the analysis does suggest that donating equipment can improve the available healthcare options.\n\n>On the other hand, investments in capacity building, health technology management and infrastructure could nearly double the amount of working medical equipment without the expense of collecting, testing, and shipping used medical devices.\n\nWhy is this seemingly simple process so ineffective?\nFrom [Beyond good intentions: lessons on equipment donation from an African hospital][2]\n\n> While researching this subject the authors found guidelines for medical equipment donations produced by WHO in 2000. They identify four principles of \"good donation practice\": \n\n> 1. the ensuring of maximum benefit to the recipient, \n> 2. respect for the wishes and context of the recipient, \n> 3. the avoidance of quality double standards, \n> 4. and effective donor-recipient communication and planning. \n\n> This case bears out the importance of these principles and the necessity for putting into practice guidelines that appear to have been largely overlooked. The need to strengthen health systems throughout the world is a recognized key to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. This case is illustrative of this challenge and offers support for WHO policy, and indeed support for the contention that the progression from knowledge and policy to practice is the great challenge of international health.\n\nThe WHO paper referenced in the question is relatively old (1997) \u2013 but apperently not much has changed \u2013 [Barriers for medical devices for the developing world:][3]\n\n> The most important design barrier is the lack of spare parts in the target countries. Any device designed for the developing world will be likely to stop working as soon as the first replacement part is required. [\u2026] Other possibilities for the failure to replace parts exists. The cost may be prohibitive or the hospital may lack the expertise or tools required to execute the repair. Most hospitals do not have a technician with more than a high school education. [\u2026] One of the most common problems encountered in developing world hospitals is the lack of consumables. Consumables are liquids or supplies required for the use of the equipment, but allowing only limited, or no, reuse [\u2026]\n> \n> \n> - The developing world represents a market size approximately five-times larger than the developed world.\n> \n> - Successfully capturing the developing world market will require more than selling the same devices at lower prices.

Speaking of which, some problems are not so much in the design of the process, but in the execution.

Any added ingredients that qualify for actually killing germs are just [icing on the cake][1].\nNone of the above methods I listed will so much kill but *remove* bacteria or dilute them in the sense of reducing their numbers. \nNothing that is not also harmful to you will kill *all* of the bacteria. As long as you are not ill *and required* to be or live as sterile as possible that is a good thing.\n\nYou are yourself a living being. Sounds like a fun fact but is meant to convey that \"a human\" might have [different definitions now][2] than a few decades ago. Not all bacteria are harmful. Most of them are not. Many of them are actually beneficial or even needed, like those in your gut. While gut bacteria might have quite a good reputation by now, those on your skin, that those handwashes would like to kill are only slowly getting a [better stand.][3] Everyone lives in a symbiosis with their individual microbiome. Overzealous sanitation at least disrupts this balance. Costs and benefit should be carefully calculated. \n\n\n Normal handwash is usually (more than) enough. It is not possible to really sterilise everything completely, nor would that be desirable.  \n\nAdd to that the effects of evolution:\n What does that mean in the slightly longer term?\nIn using sanitizers regularly you create an environment on your skin where the pressure to adapt is directed towards resisting the chemicals used in that agent. Some bacteria survive this attack. Compare that to their phenomenal ability to multiply and [overcome chemical onslaughts with for example antibiotics.][4] This leads to the situation that you un-train your own immune system to deal with any bacteria and disrupt the workings of the good bacteria your microbiome needs or can tolerate. Indiscriminate killing also tends to have the very unwelcome side effect of [giving just the most harmful bacteria an edge][5] in the fight for survival.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://news.rutgers.edu/research-news/handwashing-cool-water-effective-hot-removing-germs/20170529\n  [2]: http://bigthink.com/amped/humans-10-human-and-90-bacterial\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535073/\n  [4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE\n  [5]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06055-9", "13372": "First of all, thyroid hormones are actively taken up into cells and accumulate there.

While saturated fats are very unhealthy as pointed out in M. Arrowsmith's answer, there is a problem with using unsaturated oils as well. We should first note that there is no need to fry food, you can steam or boil your food, and add whole foods containing fats like avocados, walnuts, and chia seeds. There are no proven nutritional health benefits of frying foods in refined oils over a plant based diet that includes all the fats in the form of the above mentioned whole foods.  \n\nConversely, we know from many observational studies that diets that include cooking oils in any form are worse w.r.t. atherosclerosis compared to plant based diets in which no or very small amounts of cooking oils are used. Such diets do contain some amount of fat, this comes mainly from nuts, seeds and certain oily vegetables like avocados. A very recent [study of the indigenous Tsiman\u00e9 people][1] reported:\n\n> ... the Tsiman\u00e9, a forager-horticulturalist population of the Bolivian Amazon with few coronary artery disease risk factors, have the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date.\n\nOther such results had been obtained previously in other indigenous or rural populations who stick to a low fat diet containing a lot of fruits and vegetables and who get a lot of physical activity. But in the Tsiman\u00e9 study, research have been able to bring CT scanners to the remote locations where the  Tsiman\u00e9 live to directly measure coronary artery calcium scores, while the older studies used more indirect methods. E.g. as [reported in the landmark article that made the link between cholesterol and heart disease][2]\n\n> In the African population of Uganda coronary heart disease is almost non-existent. This statement is confirmed by adequate necropsy evidence. In the Asian community, on the other hand, coronary heart disease is a major problem. \n\nThe article goes on to link the differences to the differences in cholesterol level which is then argued to be due to the differences in the percentage of calories coming from oils, it was 30\u201345% in the Asian community while 10-15% in the African community. Note that the Tsiman\u00e9 also get 14% of their calories from fats.\n\nThen having established that a low fat diet and a generally healthy lifestyle that includes eating lots of vegetables and getting plenty of exercise yields a low rates of heart disease in indigenous populations, one also needs to consider how other indigenous populations fare who eat a high fat diet. E.g. there exists a popular myth about Eskimos having very low rates of heart disease despite eating a high fat, meat based diet containing hardly any fruits and vegetables. But as [pointed out here:][3]\n\n> During the 1970s, 2 Danish investigators, Bang and Dyerberg, on being informed that the Greenland Eskimos had a low prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) set out to study the diet of this population. Bang and Dyerberg described the \u201cEskimo diet\u201d as consisting of large amounts of seal and whale blubber (ie, fats of animal origin) and suggested that this diet was a key factor in the alleged low incidence of CAD. This was the beginning of a proliferation of studies that focused on the cardioprotective effects of the \u201cEskimo diet.\u201d In view of data, which accumulated on this topic during the past 40 years, we conducted a review of published literature to examine whether mortality and morbidity due to CAD are indeed lower in Eskimo/Inuit populations compared with their Caucasian counterparts. Most studies found that the Greenland Eskimos and the Canadian and Alaskan Inuit have CAD as often as the non-Eskimo populations. Notably, Bang and Dyerberg's studies from the 1970s did not investigate the prevalence of CAD in this population; however, their reports are still routinely cited as evidence for the cardioprotective effect of the \u201cEskimo diet.\u201d\n\nSo, the known facts on heart disease prevalence and diets in different populations paints a clear picture: using cooking oils is done at your own peril. But what about using only the healthy unsaturated oils, surely we can evade problems by using, say, olive oil?  The main problem with this is that  you're going to eat much more oil than the typical 10 to 15% of the natural intake that is seen in indigenous populations that are free of heart disease. This especially in case of a 90 year old grandmother as mentioned in the OP's question whose energy intake and use will be quite low. A few tablespoons of oil will already get you over this limit which makes frying food quite difficult. But why would that be a problem?\n\nThe problem is due to the \"empty calories effect\", the larger the fraction of the oil of the total energy intake, the less room will be left for energy in the form of whole grain carbs such as brown rice, whole grain bread and whole grain pasta. Even if you use the most healthy oils known like olive oil, the more you use of such oils the more you're going to miss out on the health benefits of the whole grain carbs. These health benefits come from not only the vitamins and minerals in whole grain carbs, but also from the fibers. \n\nFibers are converted in the intestines by gut bacteria to short chained fatty acids (SCFAs) which the body uses for a whole host of things. It has been shown that SCFAs [reduce cholesterol levels][4]. Besides whole grains, whole foods that contain fats such as walnuts and chia seeds also contain a lot of useful nutrients including fibers. We have to note here that [Total dietary fiber intake should be 25 to 30 grams a day from food, not supplements. Currently, dietary fiber intakes among adults in the United States average about 15 grams a day.][5] Indigenous populations like the Tsiman\u00e9 get more than twice the recommended amounts (I checked this from my own diet which is similar to what the Tsiman\u00e9 eat), suggesting that the recommended amount is way too low. A 20 year-old may then be able to boost fiber intake while still using using significant amounts of cooking oils, but what about a sedentary 90 year old?\n\nIn summary, cooking oils have no health benefits, we don't need to use them. Using the healthier unsaturated oils is not a good option either compared to not using any cooking oils, because you're going to get less nutrients as a result. This is going to be more of a problem the older and less physically active you are. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/fulltext\n  [2]: https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/5/1221/712631/Serum-cholesterol-diet-and-coronary-heart-disease\n  [3]: http://www.onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(14)00237-2/fulltext\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735932/\n  [5]: https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing_fiber_intake/", "4406": "So this was an interesting one for me, because I never seriously tried to consider it.  Most online sources that claim this say it's an \"old army trick,\" but after reading [several][1] perspectives on wound care in the [military][2], I don't know that is true.\n\nThe actual historical roots on this idea I could find actually go back to reference a [slave owner][3] using it as a form of abuse to over work his slave, or a [short fiction][4] story from 1915.\n\nThe problem is one of timing.  As wars started to utilize gun powder more, tourniquets were realized to be superior to cauterization (first ideas of tourniquets go back to ~1500's, serious implantation with Jean Petit in early 1700's).  By the time we get to something like Vietnam, not only would the solders have had tourniquets, if they were going to cauterize the wound they would have done it chemically.\n\nAnother problem is the gas and force released from igniting gun powder.  It doesn't just burn hot, it propels.  That's why it's useful for moving bullets.  I think this would likely further distort the tissue, and if applied in large amounts in to major arteries/veins, a good deal of toxicity problems.\n\nI just honestly think this would cause more harm than good.  I'd be very interested if someone can find a documented example of where this was actually tried in the field (and I missed it).  Considering you can't readily treat your own neck, the appropriate thing to do would be to apply direct pressure with your hands to the places that are bleeding the most (or if you're the one helping, then the same to the other person's neck).  \n\nOddly enough I have a [more detailed SE answer][5] written up in Bio, for those interested in proper wound care in the neck.\n\n\n----------\n\nEdit:\n-----\n\nI was made aware the \"Dual Survival\" episode where one of the characters cauterizes a wound ([YouTube Video Here][6] and then [here][7]).  You will note that even the survivalist unequivocally rejected this method as valid before he did it to himself (presumably for considerable compensation from Discovery Channel).  I reject this as a valid example for the following reasons:\n\n 1. That was a shallow wound where the bleeding was mostly controlled, (from the video you can see that it is hardly bleeding), and as a wound caused by a clean cut, could and should be controlled with pressure and binding.\n\n 2. You can see that the initial load of gun powder did not ignite, some initial cauterization probably occurred by dropping whatever was on fire onto the cut (looked like moss).  Further, as mentioned in the video, the gunpowder was mixing with his blood and stinging, a pretty good sign it was being introduced into his blood stream, which could cause toxicity problems.\n\n 3. Because of the shallow nature of this cut, much of the gas released was able to burst out and away from his arm.  In a wound actually calling for cauterization, the powder would have had to been placed much deeper.  Think of this problem as the difference between igniting black powder on the top of a rock vs packing it into a deep crack.  Only one of those leads to an exploding rock. \n\n 3. Further, this brings up the problem of technology again.  If they had a knife to heat, and were dead set on cauterization, they should have used the heated knife.  No additional benefit of gunpowder would be had, and there are several clear drawbacks.  As someone who hunts and hikes often, how many times will you be walking around with black powder (not newer gunpowder formulations) without a good knife?  Or for that matter, a belt and cloth and the ability to make a tourniquet (even a make-shift one).\n\nAgain, the wound in the video doesn't even call for a tourniquet, to say nothing of cauterization.  This is an example of something that makes sensational TV does not make good medical sense, and probably helps spread medical misconceptions and ignorance (as the premise of the show is to help demonstrate survivalist techniques).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706344/\n  [2]: https://books.google.com/books?id=ApUwm4KJJFYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cauterization%20Care%20of%20the%20Combat%20Amputee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin_cqQ-6rKAhWIZCYKHewEAx4Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=cauterization%20Care%20of%20the%20Combat%20Amputee&f=false\n  [3]: http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0708/2006049193-s.html\n  [4]: https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&d=SBNT19150714.1.13\n  [5]: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11058/how-to-close-a-severed-artery-vein/11088#11088\n  [6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFGE7rGUkA\n  [7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eerOKfiOuQ4", "11900": "The risk from a single CT exposure should realistically be estimated to be zero. \nThe commonly used \"linear no-threshold extrapolation model\" to get to estimates of cancer risks due to exposure to low levels of radiation (of the order of 10 mSv or less) has [no scientific basis whatsoever][1].  E.g., observations of excess cancer cases after the Chernobyl disaster have failed to find any evidence in favor of it:\n\n> Contrary to previous claims, there was no increase in leukemia or other cancers (except thyroid cancer) in regions contaminated after the Chernobyl accident where thyroid doses ranged up to 1 Sv (123). The increase in thyroid cancer among young children is correlated with dose (124), and a threshold at 200 mSv is compatible with data (125).\n\n However, the model is still useful to get to very rigorous safety standards for people who can be exposed to radiation. It's of course better to exaggerate the risk by a factor of a thousand than to underestimate it by even a small factor. Also, the risk is not the same for patients and medical staff, a patient may be exposed only a few times in his/her life whole the medical staff could be exposed several times a day if they would not leave the room where the patient is scanned.\n\nThe faults in the DNA that lead to cancer are overwhelmingly the result of [DNA replication errors][2], not due to exposure to background radiation of few mSv to a few dozen mSv per year, so we don't need to worry about getting CT scans. We should worry about what we eat, whether we get enough exercise, and we should avoid stress (so, actually, we shouldn't worry too much), as these factors do impact on biological processes that are related to cancer risks. Here we need to consider that random DNA damage is not going to cause cancer, it has to be very specific damage affecting certain genes in crucial places. Also, the immune system which can then still eliminate the threat, has to fail to do so. If you stick to a healthy lifestyle, you're going to reduce most of these independent risk factors. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663584/\n  [2]: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1330", "11885": "# CT brain at 31, what's the risk?\n\n**Short answer**: *Very little*, compared to overall cancer risk*\n\n**Longer answer**:\n\nYour girlfriend is concerned about increased risk of brain malignancy due to having a CT at age 31. This is something that the [FDA has weighed in on](https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/medicalimaging/medicalx-rays/ucm115329.htm) in a helpful summary page:\n\n> As in many aspects of medicine, there are both benefits and risks associated with the use of CT. The main risks are those associated with\n>\n> 1. test results that demonstrate a benign or incidental finding, leading to unneeded, possibly invasive, follow-up tests that may present additional risks and\n> 2. the increased possibility of cancer induction from x-ray radiation exposure.\n>\n> The *probability for absorbed x-rays to induce cancer* or heritable mutations leading to genetically associated diseases in offspring *is thought to be **very small** for radiation doses of the magnitude that are associated with CT procedures*.\n\n*(all emphases mine)*\n\n## Hold on, the effective dose is much higher than a chest x-ray! \n\nThe article goes into further detail, and there is a comparison of radiation doses in a table. It is tempting to conclude that since the dose is much higher than a chest X-ray, the risk is also much higher. However, the article covers this:\n\n> A CT examination with an effective dose of 10 [millisieverts](https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115335.htm) (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x-rays.) may be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer of approximately **1 chance in 2000**.\n\nAnd further:\n\n> If you combine the natural risk of a fatal cancer and the estimated risk from a 10 mSv CT scan, the total risk may increase from *400* chances in 2000 to *401* chances in 2000.\n\n*(both emphases mine again)*\n\nThe absolute risk increase is relatively small. \n\nTo put it another way: if someone were to (unfortunately) develop an ultimately-fatal cancer having had a CT scan; it would be unlikely that the cancer was a result of the CT scan.\n\n\nThese things do matter on a larger scale, when considering populations; but your girlfriend can (hopefully) put this fear behind her. \n\n## So what do I say?\n\nThat being said, sometimes medical fears or those around adverse effects can be tricky to let go of. We are adept at spotting patterns, and if something happens after the fact, [we tend to assume it happened as a result of the fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc). \n\nIf she is amenable, a sensitive discussion about what happened in the lead up and around the time of the CT may let your girlfriend express some previously-unexpressed fears or emotions, and hopefully move past her worry about the risk of malignancy from the CT itself. If the vents were traumatic, or if she does feel it's 'obsessive', she may benefit from discussing it in counselling- some folks have the perception that counselling is only for the most deeply troubled or traumatic of events; but it can help in a very wide variety of circumstances.\n\n----\n\n<sup><sup>*</sup> Astute readers will point out that there is [some debate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-ct-scans-increase-risk-cancer/) over the [data used to model risk](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.12121137); these still tend to consider the bigger picture of population risk (eg 70 million CT scans year<sup>-1</sup> in the US)</sup>\n\n\n----\n\n## Further Reading:\n\n - [FDA page on CT radiation risks](https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/medicalimaging/medicalx-rays/ucm115329.htm)\n - [FDA explanation of radiation quantities and units](https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115335.htm)\n - [\"Radiation Risk From Medical Imaging\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996147/)\n", "11716": "# How can I deal with standing for long periods?\n\n## I have an odd sensation, like pins and needles\n\nThe technical name for that kind of altered sensation is [paraesthesia](http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/articles/numbness-and-tingling).

Mental health did not appear to be related. \n\n However, given that the results were self-reported, only 56% of people responded to the survey, and there were patterns between various demographics and modes of transportation, the results are not conclusive, even given the vast number of individuals studied.

Cyclists and walkers had much better cardiovascular health than non-active commuters in cars, buses, trains, and subways. This may lead to lower risks of obesity and diabetes.\n\nExposure to air pollution varied. Commuters using the subways were exposed to different levels of different air particles than aboveground commuters.

First, some basic terminology is in order:\n\n 1. **Microbiota** - this is a general name for a \"community\" (for lack of a better word) of different types of microorganisms. Specifically, the [human microbiota][2] is the entire community of microbial organisms that inhabit the human body. See [this text][3] for elaboration.\n 2. **Microbiome** - this is a general name for the collection of genes of a certain microbial community. The human microbiome is the collection of genes of the human microbiota, and is the subject of an extensive study due to the potential health benefits its manipulation may provide.\n 3. **Gut microbiota** - this should be clear already... this is the entire microbial community that resides in the digestive system. It is also called '[gut flora][4]'. This concept is not unique to humans, so we will refer to the human gut microbiota from now on.\n 4. **Probiotics** - as ProfK correctly noted in his comment, probiotics is the commonly used name for the content of \"good bacteria\", which are essentially the same bacteria that naturally inhabit our digestive system (specifically the colon), in the form of a commercial product.\n\nRegarding your first question - **What are the bacteria in your large intestine doing that benefits health/immunity?**:\n\n*Gut bacteria use mostly fermentation to generate energy, converting sugars in part to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that are used by the host as an energy source. The main end-products are acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFA help increase gut motility, decrease gut pH, and provide energy for commensal bacteria. Besides SCFA, a number of amino acids that are indispensable to humans are provided by commensal bacteria. It has been well established that some microbial species may be responsible for the synthesis of vitamins like biotin, phylloquinone, and vitamin K, and deficiencies may directly or indirectly be associated with reduction in abundance of specific components of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota also plays an important role in preventing comorbidities and infection in addition to influencing mood regulation, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and cognition.*\n\nRegarding your title question - **How do probiotics work?** - I will only cite this short paragraph: *Probiotics can act through multiple mechanisms to affect the health of the host. They can transform dietary components into bioactive molecules, modulate the microbiota, or interact directly with the host immune or nervous system.*  \nPlease see the section on mechanism for a deeper explanation and specific examples for probiotic mechanisms.\n\nFinal point: [many studies][5] show all kinds of health benefits associated with probiotics in different states of disease. They cannot be covered here, but the review I cited can be a pretty good starting point. One of the main uses of probiotics is following (or together with) an antibiotic treatment, in order to replace some of the gut flora that might be destroyed by the antibiotics - antibiotics do not differentiate between \"good\" and \"bad\" bacteria, and some research (e.g. [this study][6] and [this study][7]) indicates that taking probiotics close to an antibiotic treatment may help to restore the gut flora (which has a significant role in the human body as discussed earlier) faster and help to overcome the bacterial infection better and faster.\n\n\n  [1]: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12664-015-0547-6\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiota\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3426293/\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=probiotics%20benefits\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645894\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291194", "10639": "Birth control pills omitted for one day and having unprotected sex will not result in pregnancy if you have taken missed pill and the pill you  should been taking on Wednesday. \nBirth control pills are comprised of sex hormones and work by suppressing ovulation.

Hypothesis #0: Both conditions (thyroid nodules and symptoms of\n    hyperthyroidism) are independent. Hyperthyroid symptoms including\n    anxiety, hair loss, fatigue and palpitations are unspecific.\n    Although they are typical for thyrotoxicosis, they may also result\n    from other conditions, e.g. masked depression or pheochromocytoma.\n\n 2. Hypothesis #1: The nodules represent fully compensated toxic\n    adenomas, where somatic mutations lead to constitutive activation of\n    TSH signaling. Since autonomic production is fully compensated,\n    concentrations of thyroid hormones remain within their respective\n    reference ranges. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis result from deviation\n    of free T4 concentrations from the personal set point of thyroid\n    homeostasis. It is well known that the intra-individual variation of\n    TSH and free T4 concentrations is much smaller than inter-individual\n    variance (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889165 and\n    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567792 ). This is a consequence\n    of an individual set point of the pituitary-thyroid feedback control\n    mechanism, which is encoded as TRH signaling from the hypothalamus.\n    Deviations of thyroid hormones within the reference range may still\n    lead to symptoms if they are far from the personal set point. See\n    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635726 for a review article\n    discussing this topic and\n    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480737 for a method for\n    reconstructing the personal set point.\n\n 3. Hypothesis #2: This is somewhat similar to hypotheses #1. The\n    nodules represent fully compensated toxic adenomas (like in\n    hypothesis #1), but they predominantly produce T3, which results\n    from intracellular hyperdeiodination (ensuing from constitutive\n    activation of TSH signaling and consecutive stimulation of the\n    distal part of the TSH-T3 shunt). T3 concentrations remain within\n    their reference ranges, but are above the range of concentrations\n    that are appropriate for the personal receptor sensitivity. See\n    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23339744/ for a discussion of\n    this topic.

Hypothesis #3: The thyroid nodules produce non-classical thyroid\n    hormones (e.g. 3,5-T2, a highly active T4 metabolite), which\n    destabilize the heart rhythm and exert other symptoms of\n    hyperthyroidism. This is an understudied topic. One of the few\n    papers discussing this condition is\n    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279999 .\n    \n 5. Hypothesis #4: T3 is secreted episodically from thyroid nodules, so\n    that it is missed from diagnostic work-up. This is also an\n    understudied topic.

They may also be more conservative in the OR when giving fluids as to not flood the lungs.\n\nThe answer is that evidence is unclear but the current practice is the above.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=6202406\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6205617\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6185024\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=77697\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=1704473\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=2410201\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24485131\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=9751352", "4932": "## What causes these stretch marks?\n\nStretch marks (striae) are caused by intradermal tears, that means tears that occur within the skin layers. These tears are caused when two things happen at the same time.\n\n1. The skin is stretching at a high rate. This happens when you gain weight rapidly, are pregnant, or are otherwise undergoing changes in body shape - as happens during the adolescent and teenage years.\n\n2. There's not enough new collagen being synthesized in the skin to accommodate that stretching.\n\n## Is it common to get them at a young age? \n\nYes - in this case meaning adolescent and teenage years. The reasons are twofold:\n\nFirst, these are years when your body is undergoing changes in shape and composition. The skin has to stretch to accommodate these changes.\n\nSecond, something we haven't discussed yet is the effect of cortisol on collagen synthesis. Cortisone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress among other things. It's been shown to inhibit collagen synthesis, effectively making the skin (and cartilage in the joints) less stretchy.\n\n## Are they more common in some people than others (besides what was mentioned above?)\n\nPeople with increased adrenal cortical activity, such as teenagers and those with Cushing's disease.\n\n\n### References\n\n[\"The cause of striae distensae\"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/294092)\n\n[\"Effects of cortisol acetate on collagen biosynthesis...\"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/196590)\n", "4403": "The quick answer is unfortunately it depends.\n\nIf we break this question down, there are three ways coffee would likely be able to effect a cough:\n\n 1. The coffee directly interacts with virus (and it is most likely a virus) causing the cough\n 2. Coffee could directly effect your immune system in such a way that it changed your body's ability to respond to the pathogen\n 3. Coffee could be directly interacting with your nervous system which induces the cough reflex ([neurogenic cough][1] is a real problem)\n\nFor item 1, I've seen [some evidence][2] that coffee might actually help stop flu.  For the [common cold][3], which is mostly likely (*) one of a few viruses, I couldn't find any evidence of caffeine or the other known [biologically active components of coffee][4] effecting them one way or the other.  There could be another interaction here that we don't know about it, and it could be positive or negative, so at the moment this might be a slight reason to drink coffee, not avoid it. \n\n(*) It's worth noting I disagree with the breakdown of viral prevalence listed in Wikipedia, and have discussed as much in a [Bio.SE answer][5].\n\n2) Ok there has been a looooot of research on caffeine and the immune system, especially when related to exercise.  Some will say it [helps][6], others [not much][7] (especially under [usual conditions][8]), and an [honest review][9] on it concludes that there are too many other factors that dictate whether caffeine has an effect (with exercise) that we can't really know.  But this when considering healthy patients.  With sick cells, animals, or people we can know more.\n\nAt really [high doses][10] caffeine can be anti-inflammatory, but it's probably not a good idea for the general public to be dosing that much caffeine.\n\nThis is where things get a little confusing and more relevant.  At much more normal doses, [caffeine is proinflammatory][11] in the lung.  So if you have an on going infection in the lung, you don't want to encourage the inflammation (which is probably causing the caugh).\n\nThat said, if you chronically drink coffee, your [body may have tolerized][12] to it, and the effect could be minimal (might be minimal anyway, see the sports guys).\n\nNumber 3 is actually a lot harder, as things can very based on a lot of other factors (like tolerance).  If you have a caffeine overdose, a lot of [bad things][13] can happen.  One of them is that nerves might fire [action potentials][14] at [lower thresholds][15], which could mean the nerves detecting the inflammation in your lungs could fire more easily.\n\n[Chances are][12], however, that [they won't][16], and you won't be drinking an unusual amount of coffee.\n\n-------\nTo conclude, in an acute infection I would recommend avoiding caffeine, but it won't cause an undo amount of harm.  Decaf will even have the other compounds whose benefit would otherwise be swamped out by caffeine.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222934/\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050906\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold\n  [4]: http://llufb.llu.lv/conference/foodbalt/2011/FOODBALT-Proceedings-2011-110-115.pdf\n  [5]: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold/21802#21802\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558577\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308693\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21152932\n  [9]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974722\n  [10]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149008\n  [11]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19564571\n  [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465359\n  [13]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196726\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential\n  [15]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8556193\n  [16]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314542", "3938": "I'll start off by highlighting a couple of more general studies:\n\n - [Cole & Schumacher (2005)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15712981): A general study of corticosteroids, this found that some corticosteroids may be free of side effects (specifically, intraarticular corticosteroids) for a series of short-term injections for a short amount of time (one injection every three months for two years). However, other corticosteroids can cause tissue atrophy, if used for long periods of time - even for periods as short as two years. That said, the authors believe that more general research is needed to draw definitive conclusions. A full pdf of the study is available [here](http://www.pacificaorthopedics.org/downloads/sek/Steroid_Injections_Clinical_Practice.pdf).\n - [Raynauld et al. (2003)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571845): This is a study on general intraarticular steroids, as applied to osteoarthritis, which also found that there were no effects from the injections. Over two years, minimal side effects were noted. This used the same intervals as in Cole & Schumacher: One injection every three months for about two years.\n\nThese studies did not specifically address the cortisone shots you're concerned with; instead, they dealt with the more broader class of drugs called [corticosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid). I find the results of these studies interesting, because there are a lot of websites out there that say the exact opposite: That a range of side effects are possible if used long-term, and may very well occur. I highlighted these studies in part to show that more research may well be needed, and that different drugs may work better for different people.\n\nThe CDC has [a list of potential side effects from the use of corticosteroids](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dba/corticosteroid.html). The potential short-term side effects are too many to list, but I'll cover the long-term ones:\n\n - Growth problems in children\n - Brittle bones\n - Muscle weakness (see the tissue atrophy mentioned in Cole & Schumacher)\n - Diabetes\n - Eye issues\n\n*However* - and this is an enormous \"however\" - this appears to be focused mainly on doses taken orally, and perhaps daily. In other words, side effects might change based on the method of intake, although this might be only a minor difference. Additionally, these are the effects of using corticosteroids on a much more frequent basis than you would be having them - and even then, these effects are only possibilities.\n\nThese studies are the closest approximations I can combine to address your specific case. It seems that three-month intervals are the longest period of time that has been studied in any depth. In other words, your regimen seems to be a rare one - and a safer one.\n\nEvery cortisone shot has the potential for side effects. But the combined effect of these multiple shots would most likely be have been diluted substantially. Studies with intervals of three months brought no side effects (and the risks given by the CDC appear to be due to repeated, short-term doses), and so it seems highly unlikely that your case will be any severer.", "4137": "There is at least one study on this, published in *The Lancet*:\n\n[Red blood cell magnesium and chronic fatigue syndrome][1]\n\n> Patients treated with magnesium claimed to have improved energy levels, better emotional state, and less pain, as judged by changes in the Nottingham health profile. \n\nThis was a trial on only 20 patients with CSF and 20 control patients.

Is this a difference in *perception* (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in *placement* (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?\n\nFloaters do move, but not very much. Mostly they \"sway and settle\" when we shift our focus of vision. Noticing floaters is likely a difference in perception, for example moving your line of sight from one which is complex to one with a simple background, for (a completely made up) example, from looking at a large painting to looking at a ceiling. The lack of contrast will make the irregularities in vision caused by floaters to stand out/be noticeable for a few minutes, maybe even be bothersome and worrisome, but it soon stops. You can \"find\" floaters by doing that, especially if you look into a softly lit surface, like an x-ray view box without the x-rays. \n\n>How do floaters \"work\"?\n\nThe vitreous humor (the very structures gel-like collagen & fluid substance in the eyeball behind the iris) starts to break down/liquify in spots as we age; this is a common and benign cause of age-related floaters. You can picture how floaters work by imagining crystal-clear jello that had set in a clear glass. If you took a hot knife and quickly swiped it through the jello, some of the jello would melt; you would see an aberration in the path of light through that spot; you wouldn't see perfectly through it. Turn the glass and the aberration would be different at different angles. That's approximately how floaters work. Some are minimal, some are more marked because of the plane of liquifaction/separation of collagen fibers. They do not \"move\", though, through the vitreous any more than that melted jello moves through the whole.\n\n>This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something...\n\nSudden onset of floaters disturbing your visual field are most likely not the more benign aging process of vitreous breakdown, and merit a trip (or at *least* a call) to the opthalmologist. Those kinds of floaters (sometimes associated with flashes) tend to be caused by vitreous detachment from the retina, and can lead to retinal detachments and/or hemorrhages. While often just isolated in nature, it can be a sign of more serious and vision-threatening retinal pathology.\n\n>I'd like to avoid a recurrence.\n\nI don't know of any way at all to predict or restrict recurrences unless there is retinal pathology being treated by an opthalmologist.\n\n<sub>[Floaters](https://nei.nih.gov/health/floaters/floaters)</sub>  \n<sub>[Acute-onset floaters and flashes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291672/)</sub>  \n \n", "3319": "There seem to be a couple different issues under discussion.

[These are effective.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25055206)<sup>1</sup>  Commonly used methods (similar to [those used to abort supraventricular tachycardia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7416025)) include:    \n\n- cold stimulation of the nasopharynx (upside down with ice water in the mouth will do it),  \n- carotid sinus massage, and\n- [Valsalva maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver).\n\n  In theory, a sudden *increase* in [afterload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterload) could also stimulate vagal tone via baroreceptors. When you describe squatting and breath-holding maneuvers, this is reminiscent of techniques that affect afterload and preload,<sup>2</sup> namely:  \n \n- squatting (vs. standing) increases both preload and afterload;  \n\n- deep inspiration increases preload to the R heart but decreases venous return to the L heart and thus systemic (including carotid sinus) pressure.\n\n  In theory, squatting and exhaling would be the combination that most effectively increases afterload and could theoretically trigger a vagal response. However, I\u2019m not aware of any data suggesting that these are practically effective for termination of hiccups.\n\n2. **Orthostasis**. You have outlined an effective method of temporarily depriving your brain of adequate blood flow and eliciting symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.<sup>3</sup> This is due to decreased preload to the L heart, most marked upon inspiration occurring simultaneous with standing from the squatting position. This tends to trigger the *sympathetic* nervous system rather than the *parasympathetic*. It is the latter that is associated with vagal tone helpful for terminating hiccups.   \n\n**In summary**:\nYes, standing up while inhaling will cause systemic blood pressure to fall with resulting decreased cerebral perfusion. This is generally unpleasant and does not come highly recommended. This is unlikely to be effective for hiccups.\n\n-----\n\n<sub>  \n1.

The general rule for any medicine is that the benefits should outweigh the risks. (1) Both types of medicines that you ask about have some potentially serious side-effects. For aspirin they go from gastrointestinal disturbances, mucosal damage and slight asymptomatic blood loss to increased bleeding time and hemorrhagic stroke. (2,3) Statins, on the other hand, can also cause gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatitis and pancreatitis. Rhabdomyolysis, although rare is a very serious potential side-effect. (2)\n\nNow, what about the potential benefits?\n\nAspirin\n----------\n\nAs for aspirin, some studies have shown that aspirin is effective in primary prevention and recommendations for its use are (3):\n\n> *If an annual risk of coronary heart disease of < or =0.6% exists, aspirin is normally not indicated; for a risk of 0.7-1.4% the facts should be discussed with the patient. If a risk of > or =1.5% exists, aspirin should be given.*\n\nSome authors state that in diabetic patients the annual risk is always higher than 1.5% and therefore aspirin should be indicated in there patients. (4) However, the same study reports evidence from scientific literature showing that:\n\n> *cardiovascular mortality of diabetic patients is as high as in nondiabetic patients with known coronary artery disease*\n\nAnother meta-analysis concludes (5):\n\n> *Whereas estimates of benefit among patients with diabetes remain imprecise, **our analysis suggests that the relative benefit of aspirin is similar in patients with and without diabetes.***\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nThis is in line with The European Society of Cardiology and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines published in 2007 (6):\n\n> Aspirin should be given for the same indications and in similar dosages to diabetic and non-diabetic patients.\n\n**Note that all of these studies are for patients with diabetes, not pre-diabetes.** So, we can probably conclude that pre-diabetes on its own, without other proven risk factors for cardiovascular disease is not sufficient to indicate preventive use of aspirin. \n\nStatins\n----\n\nEuropean recommendations state:\n\n> - In diabetic patients **with CVD**, statin therapy should be initiated regardless of baseline LDL cholesterol, with a treatment target of <1.8\u20132.0\u2005mmol/L (<70\u201377\u2005mg/dL)\n>\n> - Statin therapy should be considered in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, **without CVD, if total cholesterol >3.5\u2005mmol/L (>135\u2005mg/dL)**, with a treatment targeting an LDL cholesterol reduction of 30\u201340%\n\n(emph. mine)\n\nSo the presence of risk factors additional to diabetes are clearly required. \n\nAnother review says that several studies have (4):\n\n> demonstrated that patients with diabetes showed similar relative risk reductions compared with those without diabetes ranging from 19 to 58%, dependent on the study population and the statin used. \n\nThe same study cites:\n\n> The authors of the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study trial even suggested that the debate about whether all patients with type 2 diabetes warrant statin treatment should now focus on whether any patients can reliably be identified as being at sufficiently low risk for statin treatment to be withheld.\n\nAs long as there are those, or as long as we don't know if there are such patients, it would be irresponsible to make a stiff guideline to prescribe these medicines without consideration of risks and benefits. If there are no other risk factors, it seems that evidence of benefits in pre-diabetic patients doesn't outweigh the risks of such therapy.\n________________________________________________\n\nOne of the studies does suggest that (4): \n\n> Co-administration of aspirin and statins shows additional effects in reducing cardiovascular mortality.\n\n**But** this can be used as an argument for making combination medicines known as *fixed-dose combination medicines*. The only true benefit is the convenience of taking one pill instead of two. A huge disadvantage is the inability to individualise the dose, along with potential interactions and double-dosing. The cost and cost-effectiveness over single active ingredient medicines depends solely on the manufacturer and other manufacturers in the field. Sometimes combination medicines are cheaper, sometimes they are more expensive. \n_________________________________________\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

I don\u00b4t see any problems with that. I have many times wondered the same thing. If you search online one will find hundreds and thousands of journal articles stating \"the remedy for hang-over\". Of course these \"remedies\" are based just on folklore.\n\nThere is also some scientific literature on this topic. The most comprehensive is [a systematic review published 2005 in British Medical Journal.][1]. Unfortunately the authors conclude: *\"The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to practise abstinence or moderation\".*\n\nI am quite sure that if an effective treatment to reduce or limit the effects of alcohol were to exist, that would have gained popularity beyond any limits.\n\nHowever, I would present on interesting theory to try. Alcohol or ethanol itself is not the bad guy. Body processes ethanol by oxidating it to acethaldehyde with the help from alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. The acethaldehyde is responsible for all the bad, including nausea, vomiting etc. It is also a [carcinogen][2] associated most importantly to gastric cancer.\n\nTo deal with this potential carcinogenity, a Finnish biotechnology Company Biohit has introduced a drug called [Acetium][3]. It is a very simple drug, it only contains l-cysteine, an essential amino acid. The trick is that L-cysteine reacts with acethaldehyde forming a compound molecule which has no meaning or effect in human body. As so the Biohit aims to market this product as a pre-emptive treatment for gastric cancer.\n\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\n\nBut the interesting part if, that is L-cysteine neutralizes acetaldehyde, why could not it therefore be an effective treatment for hangover? Just take some Acetium before drinking and do not worry about the next Morning.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Totally unrelated to the OP**. My secret dream is to perform a randomized controlled trial about this idea. Of course, prior to it, I should contact Biohit to make sure that I receive the appropriate rojalties from their sells. Let\u00b4s say this treatment really worked in my trial, I would most likely become a multi-billionaire. Alongside I would be responsible for tripling or quadrupling the amount of consumed alcohol around the world since no one would ever suffer from hang-over. People would however get more drunk since this drug only prevents hangover. As so, the rate of homicides, beatings and drunk driving would go thorough the roof. Maybe I should not be waiting any medal from the parliament or president. Perhaps I should abandon my research idea.... \n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322250/\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde#Carcinogenicity\n  [3]: http://www.acetium.com/\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/OldWs.png", "1747": "[Vitamin D plays an important role in the immune system][1], and there is some evidence that higher vitamin D levels help people to prevent upper respiratory tract infections, [see here][2]:\n\n> There have been multiple cross-sectional studies associating lower levels of vitamin D with increased infection. One report studied almost 19,000 subjects between 1988 and 1994. Individuals with lower vitamin D levels (<30 ng/ml) were more likely to self-report a recent upper respiratory tract infection than those with sufficient levels, even after adjusting for variables including season, age, gender, body mass and race[8]. Vitamin D levels fluctuate over the year. Although rates of seasonal infections varied, and were lowest in the summer and highest in the winter, the association of lower serum vitamin D levels and infection held during each season. Another cross-sectional study of 800 military recruits in Finland stratified men by serum vitamin D levels[9]. Those recruits with lower vitamin D levels lost significantly more days from active duty secondary to upper respiratory infections than recruits with higher vitamin D levels (above 40 nmol). There have been a number of other cross-sectional studies looking at vitamin D levels and rates of influenza [10] as well as other infections including bacterial vaginosis[11] and HIV[12-13]. All have reported an association of lower vitamin D levels and increased rates of infection.\n\n[The basic mechanisms that are known can be summarized as follows:][3]\n\n[![Basic picture][4]][4]\n\n> The immunomodulatory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 targets different players of the innate and adaptive immune compartment. 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates innate immune responses by enhancing the chemotactic and phagocytotic responses of macrophages as well as the production of antimicrobial proteins such as cathelicidin. On the other hand, 1,25(OH)2D3 also modulates adaptive immunity. At the level of the APC (like the DC), 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits the surface expression of MHC-II-complexed antigen and of co-stimulatory molecules, in addition to production of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, thereby indirectly shifting the polarization of T cells from a Th1 and Th17 phenotype towards a Th2 phenotype. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 directly affects T cell responses, by inhibiting the production of Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-21), and by stimulating Th2 cytokine production (IL-4). Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 favors Treg cell development via modulation of DCs and by directly targeting T cells. Finally, 1,25(OH)2D3 blocks plasma cell differentiation, IgG and IgM production and B cell proliferation.\n\nIn addition to this, [vitamin D is needed to build muscle][5], heavy exercise will deplete vitamin D levels, potentially compromising your immune system:\n\n>Our findings support our hypothesis. Analysis of our results showed that vitamin D levels are associated with neuromuscular performance and aerobic capacity in professional soccer players. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time our study provides evidence of a linear relationship between vitamin D serum levels, not only with jumping performance, but also with VO2max and speed in non-supplemented soccer players. In addition, we have found that even the short off-season period of reduced training stress had a boosting effect on vitamin D levels. Interestingly, this increase in vitamin D levels was evident in parallel to a reduction in aerobic and neuromuscular performance parameters. The latter finding strengthens the well-documented concept that training plays the principal role for exercise adaptations and improvements in exercise performance, whereas all other parameters including vitamin D play a supportive role.\n\nI make sure I get about 7000 IU of vitamin D per day, and I keep my calcidiol level at about 200 nmol/l. In the summer I adjust the intake of vitamin D supplements to take into account the amount I get from the Sun, in the winter I get the entire dose of 7000 IU/day from supplements (I then take 10,000 IU/day, 5 times per week). Note that such doses and calcidiol levels [are safe][6].\n\nI don't exercise in a gym, I only exercise outside. This helps to build immunity against cold viruses early on when they are still evolving to become next winter's scourge. When you run, your lungs filter the air less, allowing viruses to enter your body more easily. Also, you are inhaling an enormous amount of air up to ten times more per unit time compared to being in rest. Chances are then that your immune system will already have encounter the cold viruses that will later mutate a bit and then make many people ill.\n\n\n  [1]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096695\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/\n  [3]: http://www.nature.com/bonekey/knowledgeenvironment/2011/1104/bonekey20110505/fig_tab/bonekey20110505_F1.html\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/92l9O.jpg\n  [5]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101659\n  [6]: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/2/582S.full", "1753": "First, let me say that I highly doubt your assertion that workouts make you more likely to get ill than someone who \"just goes to the office & back each day.\" I don't know what you base that assertion on and I think you're 100% wrong until you can provide evidence to support it. Working out and staying fit have the exact opposite effect, if anything. Why are you even doing it if you think being fit makes you sick?\n\nThat said, it is true that you touch a lot of surfaces at a gym that many other people touch, and that does indeed open a pathway to infection.

Most mainly involve soap.\n\nIn my personal experience, which comes with significant scientific backing, two simple things will prevent more upper respiratory infections than anything else you can do:\n\n1) [Wash your hands -- well and often][2]. And since you can't do that as often as you should, [carry a bottle of alcohol hand sanitizer][3] in your car, your purse, or wherever you'll actually have it when you need it.

Just never touch mucous membranes with bare fingers.\n\nDo those two things, then put your wallet back in your pocket at the vitamins and supplements store, and enjoy your freedom from upper respiratory tract infections.\n\n\n  [1]: http://health.universityofcalifornia.edu/2012/12/13/cold-supplements-from-airborne-to-zinc/\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16553905\n  [3]: http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\n  [4]: http://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/", "1764": "You're essentially asking if you can eat food and then eat more food.

In fact these two sorts of capsules have to comply with different pharmacopoeial requirements: \n\n*Gastro-resistant capsules*:\n\n> ***Disintegration**. For capsules with a gastro-resistant shell carry out the test for disintegration [...] use 0.1 M hydrochloric acid as the liquid\nmedium and operate the apparatus for 2 h, or other such time as may be authorised, without the discs. Examine the state of the capsules.**The time of resistance to the acid medium** varies according to the formulation of the capsules to be examined. It is typically 2 h to 3 h but even with authorised deviations it **must not be less than 1 h. No capsule shows signs of disintegration or rupture permitting the escape of the contents.*** (Ph.Eur.5.0)\n\nWhereas for *hard capsules* it says:\n\n> *Use water R as the liquid medium. When justified and authorised, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid or artificial gastric juice R may be used as the liquid medium. [...] Operate the apparatus **for 30 min**, unless otherwise justified and authorised and examine the state of the capsules. **The capsules comply with\nthe test if all 6 have disintegrated.*** (Ph.Eur.5.0)\n\nSome strains of probiotics are found to be [acid resistant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151822/#r27) which can be enhanced by formulation factors other than gastro-resistant coating. On the other hand, manufacturers of probiotics in gastro-resistant capsules often state (on their websites e.g.) that they deliver more units of probiotic bacteria to the intestines than conventional dosage forms. (It may depend on the strains they use.) Some probiotics can be found in yoghourt which is definitely not gastro-resistant. \n\nRegulatory requirements are much stricter for medicines than for supplements in most countries, so if one is concerned with the sufficient drug delivery and the accuracy of medical claims, it is useful to know that for medicines to be approved for marketing much firmer evidence about these (and other concerns) has to be submitted.\n___________________\n\nWhy does powder exist as a dosage form? There may be several reasons to produce and market oral powder as a dosage form: some people have difficulties to swallow capsules, it may depend on manufacturer's production line, powders allow for **individualised** dosage (measuring the dose for a specific patient - but I don't think this would be necessary with probiotics), hygroscopic excipients which are incompatible with capsule shell etc. \n\nThe dose you take in powder **is not more precise** - even if it is sold in divided doses (each dose in one bag), because a small amount of powder can always remain on the walls. The precision of measurement is the same at best, if not in favour of the capsules.\n\nHow to chose?\n------\n\nHere are some of the questions that should be taken into account:\n\n 1. Is the patient allergic/intolerant to any of the formulation's ingredients?\n 2. Is there a form preferred by the patient's physician, for some medical reason?\n 3. Which form is the most convenient one for you?\n 4. Which form is accessible and affordable to you?", "123": "NOTE: this answer only focuses on proteins.\n\nShort answer\n------------\nWith beans (beans, chickpeas, lentils, etc.) and cereals.\n\nLong answer\n-----------\nThere are proteins in many vegetable foods, the difference with meat is the percentage of protein. Here you have a table of protein content of most protein-rich plant foods, plus beef meat for comparison (values are g  of protein per 100 g of uncooked product):\n\n - beef meat 22\n - beans 24\n - chickpeas 21\n - lentils 23\n - wheat (bread, pasta, etc.) 10-13\n - corn 10\n - rice 6-8\n\nIn a omnivore diet, meat is just one source of proteins among others, and provides just a part of total protein intake. It's perfectly possible to get enough proteins without meat. Actually our society is suffering from diseases that are caused by excess, not lack, of proteins [3,4].\n\nEssential amino acids\n---------------------\nEvery protein we eat through the diet is made of amino acids. There are some amino acids we need to eat in order to satisfy our requirements, these are called *essential amino acids*. \n\nWhile meat contains all essential amino acids, common vegetable foods -individually- lack some essential amino acid. The essential amino acids that are not found in some vegetable foods can be found in other vegetable foods, for this reason it's important to eat variedly. If focusing on one type of bean, like soy, can lead to deficiencies, we avoid them by rotating the consumption of beans and cereals over the week. Some examples can be found on the web[[1]].\n\nVegan diets\n-----------\nWhat was said until now is also valid for vegan diets: diets that exclude any animal product as meat, fish, milk, dairy, eggs, honey.\n\nWith diets based on vegetable foods it's perfectly possible to satisfy all nutritional needs '*during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes*', as stated by the American Dietetic Association in 2009[[2]]. You just have to eat enough beans, cereals and vegetables (they contain proteins too).\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[3] Report of a Joint WHO / FAO Expert Consultation. (2003).

This has been shown in some [animal models][5] and [human studies][6], and may not be as much of a problem in some [silicon-based lubricants][7].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.astroglide.com/products/astroglide-liquid/\n  [2]: http://www.k-y.com/products/lubricants/k-y-liquid-lubricant-5oz\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8142525\n  [4]: http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2013/04000/Intravaginal_Practices_and_Risk_of_Bacterial.12.aspx\n  [5]: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/331\n  [6]: http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/195/5/703\n  [7]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048328", "177": "Some studies have shown that eye patching has been effective in adults.

I think a good summary of the literature would leave you with: \n> X, Y, and Z studies showed an association; \u03a7, \u03a8, and \u03a9 studies showed no association.\n\nExcellent. \u0399n lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you *why* this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented.\n\n[One study][yk] used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  \n  \n- less sugar from fruit snacks  \n- low Vitamin C \n\nHowever, the total simple sugar intake did *not* correlate with hyperactivity symptoms.\n\n**This makes very little sense.** Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?\n\n\n1. [**Statistical noise**][noise]. Data interpretation relies on a [ratio of signal:noise][dk] to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of *usual* dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal.\n\n2. [**Confounding**][confound]. A *confound* exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It\u2019s not obvious whether that would lead to *under* or *over* reporting of sugar intake. \n\n  Generally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren\u2019t measured. There was no \u201ccarelessness independent of hyperactivity\u201d score obtained here, and we couldn\u2019t expect it &mdash; it\u2019s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this.\n\n3. [**Multiple comparisons**][mcp]. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, *something* is going to be statistically associated with something else **for reasons that have nothing to do with reality.** That\u2019s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance <5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent. This is something to think about when unexpected results pop up from a study that was designed to look at something completely different.

BAV refers to the situation when there are only two cusps, a hemodynamically less favorable scenario. \n\nAlthough generally benign in itself, BAV has been associated with an increased risk of several serious complications. In particular, [aortic stenosis][as], a condition in which the blood flow exiting the heart is limited by a narrowed valve, is more common in individuals with BAV and often occurs at a younger age.

[In recent years there have already been outbreaks][3] of measles due to decreased rates of vaccination, and so there is high risk for more outbreaks. One can generalize that adults may also be missing out on key vaccines such as pneumococcal pneumonia or shingles -- perhaps there will be increased rates of pneumonia or shingles as a result.\n\nOf course, increases in both obesity and vaccine-preventable diseases can increase health risks and increase the risk of death.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227671\n  [2]: https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/measles/statement_missing_measles_vaccines_covid-19/en/\n  [3]: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/us-measles-cases-hit-1234-brooklyn-outbreak-called-over", "22909": "Short answer seems to be that there is such a category and it includes most respiratory viruses, [including](https://jvi.asm.org/content/89/6/2995) coronaviruses:\n\n> Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic was controlled by nonvaccine measures, coronaviruses remain a major threat to human health. The design of optimal coronavirus vaccines therefore remains a priority. Such vaccines present major challenges: **coronavirus immunity often wanes rapidly,** individuals needing to be protected include the elderly, and vaccines may exacerbate rather than prevent coronavirus lung immunopathology. \n\nAlas this paper considers it such a well-known fact that they don't actually bother to cite any studies in support of that particular claim. (So, if you want to further challenge this, Skeptics SE awaits you...)\n\nAnd regarding the closest know relatives of SARS-CoV-2, that is SARS (and MERS) the data on long-term immunity is not very encouraging either, as a March 18, *Nature* editorial [relates](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00798-8):\n\n> **Immunity is short-lived for the coronaviruses that cause common colds**; even people who have high levels of antibodies against these viruses can still become infected, says Stanley Perlman, a coronavirologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.\n>\n> **The evidence is more equivocal for the two other coronaviruses that have triggered epidemics: those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).** Perlman says his team has found that after people recover from MERS, their antibodies against the virus drop precipitously. He also says that his team has gathered data \u2014 not yet published \u2014 showing that SARS antibodies are still present in the body 15 years after infection. **But it\u2019s not clear whether this immune response is enough to prevent reinfection.** \u201cWe don\u2019t have good evidence of long-lasting immunity, but we also don\u2019t have really good data from both SARS and MERS,\u201d Perlman adds.\n\n---\n\nMore tangential info below:\n\nThe immune system can be damaged by some pathogens making them vulnerable to others, even if you had prior exposure to those. Besides the well-known HIV which causes general immunodeficiency, measles  can do this to some extent as well, and you do get cured from measles proper. This from a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html), I haven't checked the actual science publications:\n\n> Measles is far more dangerous than most people realize, new research shows. \n>\n> The disease itself can cause a severe and sometimes deadly illness, but two new studies published on Thursday found that even when patients recover, the virus can inflict lasting harm on their immune systems.\n>\n> The weakened immunity leaves a child vulnerable for several years to other dangerous infections like flu and pneumonia. The damage occurs because the virus kills cells that make antibodies, which are crucial to fighting off infections.\n>\n> Scientists call the effect \u201cimmune amnesia.\u201d During childhood, as colds, flu, stomach bugs and other illnesses come and go, the immune system forms something akin to a memory that it uses to attack those germs if they try to invade again. The measles virus erases that memory, leaving the patient prone to catching the diseases all over again.\n\nTechnically this a bit besides what you're asking about. The technical term is \"immunomodulation\".\n\n\n\nAlso, the adaptive response [takes](https://www.virology.ws/2009/12/28/reinfection-with-2009-influenza-h1n1/) a bit longer than people might suspect:\n\n> These individuals were likely resusceptible to reinfection with the same strain of influenza virus due to a confluence of unusual events. First, all three were reinfected within three weeks, before their primary adaptive response had sufficiently matured. Another contributing factor was the high level of circulation of the pandemic strain. [...]\n>\n> Could reinfection also occur after immunization with influenza vaccine? Yes, if the immunized individual encounters the virus before the primary antibody response matures, which occurs in 3-4 weeks. This is more likely to occur during pandemic influenza when circulation of the virus is more extensive than in non-pandemic years.\n>\n> [Citing:]\n>\n> * Perez CM, Ferres M, & Labarca JA (2010). Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Reinfection, Chile. Emerging infectious diseases, 16 (1), 156-7 PMID: 20031070\n\nAnd it's suspected that it's not actually true (as claimed in the question) that prior exposure to a family of viruses, e.g. influenza, always makes subsequent infections with different influenza strains milder. In fact, there's [some evidence](https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/18/5298310) that the W shaped mortality curve (by age) for the 1918 influenza was due to the exposure in infancy of some age groups (but not others) to a somewhat similar viruses that primed a overreaction of the immune response, which was often responsible for the rapid swelling of the lungs:\n\n> The 1918 pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus (with a Group 1 HA). Those whose first exposure had been to a putative H3N8 (Group 2) virus that emerged in 1889 were at high risk of death [20]. Crucially, because children born several years prior to a newly emerged IAV strain can experience that virus as their first (or among their first) IAV infections, one should not expect a clean demarcation of increased risk to coincide with the year of emergence of that H3N8 strain. Although the young-adult mortality rate from the 1918 virus has a sharp peak in those born very near 1889, it stretches back to include those born up to a decade or so prior to 1889 (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, it also stretches forward only a decade or so, possibly because a new H1 virus emerged in the early years of the 20th century, displacing the 1889 H3 virus [20, 24]. This idea is supported by the lack of evidence of anti-H3 antibodies in those born after the turn of the century\u2014despite clear evidence of N8 reactivities until shortly before 1918\u2014as well as by the low mortality during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic in those born before, but not after, about 1900 [20].\n>\n> [...] Nevertheless, results indicating that the 1918 virus is unusually lethal in mice [27], along with the fact that introduction of all new internal proteins in the 1918 virus could have played some role in its unusual virulence (due, e.g., to absent cellular immunity to new T cell epitopes) [20], suggest that the overall virulence of the 1918 virus may have been affected by factors other than antigenic imprinting in childhood. These uncertainties make the recovery of archival viral strains from prior to 1918 particularly attractive: exposing experimental animals such as ferrets, pigs or mice to reconstructed versions of putative H3N8 and H1N8 viruses that may have provided distinct imprinting of different cohorts in 1918 [20] may be the only way to resolve these questions and answer, finally, why this pandemic was so catastrophic.\n\nUnfortunately no genomes of pre-1918 influenzas have been reconstructed insofar, so it's presently impossible to experimentally verify this kind of \"kindling\" hypothesis, at least for 1918 pandemic.\n\nAnd more generally, [it's suspected](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/two-scenarios-if-new-coronavirus-isnt-contained/) that nobody becomes \"fully immune\" to coronaviruses and some other respiratory viruses like the RSV:\n\n> The toll of a seasonal-flu-like coronavirus also depends on immunity \u2014 which is also scientifically uncertain. Exposure to the four endemic coronaviruses produces immunity that lasts longer than that to influenza, [Richard] Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital] said, but not permanent immunity. Like respiratory syncytial virus, which can re-infect adults who had it in childhood, coronavirus immunity wanes.\n>\n> \u201cEveryone, by the time they reach adulthood, should have some immunity to some coronavirus,\u201d said Tim Sheahan, a coronavirus researcher at University of North Carolina\u2019s Gillings School of Global Public Health. But because it doesn\u2019t last, older people can get reinfected. The elderly also have a higher death rate from coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, a pattern 2019-nCoV is following.\n>\n> \u201cThere is some evidence that people can be reinfected with the four coronaviruses and that there is no long-lasting immunity,\u201d Dr. Susan Kline, an infectious disease specialist at of the University of Minnesota. \u201cLike rhinoviruses [which cause the common cold], you could be infected multiple times over your life. You can mount an antibody response, but it wanes, so on subsequent exposure you don\u2019t have protection.\u201d Subsequent infections often produce milder illness, however.\n\nI'll try to find some actual studies on this as it's the most central issue relating to the question. There are lot of papers in pubmed about [\"waning immunity\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=waning+immunity) but most are about vaccines, so that may or may not fully answer your question. But to [pick an example](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/217/6/851/4833004) (of such a paper on vaccines waning):\n\n>  For mumps, protection appears to wane over decades, prompting the use of additional doses of vaccine for outbreak control [18]. Transmission models have been used to study long-term age-specific time trends of pertussis and mumps. The best-fitting models require waning immunity, leading to the inference that vaccine protection does indeed wane, as well as providing an estimate of the rate of waning [19, 20].\n\nI think I found some [research](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006601) that might satisfy you a bit more, but it's alas not about influenzas etc.:\n\n> Determining the duration of protective immunity requires quantifying the magnitude and rate of loss of antibodies to different virus and vaccine antigens. A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it affected the longevity of protective immunity to measles, rubella, vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold (95% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others\u2014on average, they have higher antibody levels with slower decay rates. We identified different patterns for the loss of protective levels of antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively, but about 10% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only 1% to 3% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.\n\n", "22956": "At the very least, coffee (caffeine actually) can can have a complex interaction with pain medication. \n\nCaffeine can actually [enhance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018099/) the pain-relief effects of some medications, like aspirin, which is why it's included in some \"combo\" OTC painkillers in some countries. (But if you take these regularly and drink caffeinated drinks too, you may well exceed the daily RDA for caffeine, 400mg/day [according](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much) to the FDA.)\n\n[However](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/triggers-caffeine#1):\n\n> Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches.\n>\n> Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain.\n\n\nI've also heard that if you don't take any pain meds, coffee will usually enhance your feeling of pain, but I can't find any (reliable) sources to back this up, even though in some circles it is recommended you don't drink caffeinated drinks when you have some (painful) medical (or quasi-medical e.g. tattoo, piercing, laser hair removal) procedures scheduled. YMMV. (Actually a [2018 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30187108) found that habitual coffee drinkers have decreased sensitivity to pain.)\n\nThere are probably more aspects to consider including [rigors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor#Causes) and [diuresis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725310/)/[sweating](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883004), both of which are probably modulated by caffeine. \n\nWebMD [says](https://symptoms.webmd.com/cold-flu-map/how-to-stay-hydrated-when-youre-sick) (in an MD-reviewed article):\n\n> These drinks won\u2019t help you get over your cold or flu, and some could do more harm than good. [...]\n>\n> * Coffee. If you\u2019re going to sip a hot drink, might as well get your daily dose of caffeine in it, right? Wrong. Try to stick with water and nutrient-rich soups.\n\nBut rather disappointing they don't offer any reasons why coffee should be avoided in this case, except that it is inferior to \"nutrient-rich soups\". But this seems hardly a flu-specific argument, i.e. you can't expect your diet to be just coffee anyway.\n\nThe [CDC flu [patient] guide](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/general/influenza_flu_homecare_guide.pdf) makes a similar recommendation:\n\n> If the sick person is not eating well, encourage\nthem to drink liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks\nwith caffeine in them such as colas, tea, and\ncoffee.\n\nWhile apparently no reason whatsoever for avoiding coffee is given in there, this is put under the \"Tips to prevent dehydration\" heading, so it's probably due to sweating/diuresis being enhanced by caffeine. This seems to be a really controversial topic, e.g. a [Time mag](https://time.com/5192272/coffee-tea-dehydrating/) article cites some experts saying otherwise, so it's probably better left for a separate question.\n\n> It\u2019s true that caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means that it causes your kidneys to flush extra sodium and water from the body through urine. If you\u2019re peeing frequently, and thus losing lots of liquid, it\u2019s logical to think you could become dehydrated \u2014 but it actually doesn\u2019t work that way, explains Dr. Daniel Vigil, an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.\n>\n> \u201cWhen you drink a cup of coffee or you drink a glass of iced tea, you are necessarily taking in a volume of fluid along with that dose of [caffeine],\u201d Vigil says. Even though caffeine is a mild diuretic, Vigil says, you won\u2019t lose more fluid through urine than you take in by drinking a caffeinated beverage. Your body is able to absorb as much fluid as it needs and expel the rest, he says.\n\n[Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886980/) seem to back up this latter view, but they involve healthy individuals.\n", "22815": "Yes, it is possible to have no symptoms and be infected, various sources, e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179137.\n\nAs for testing after 'clearing the infection', this would be what a serological scarring test would look for, e. g.: \n\n- https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/27/serological-tests-reveal-immune-coronavirus/\n- https://www.contagionlive.com/news/florian-krammer-phd-discusses-new-coronavirus-serological-assay.", "21554": "> Is there any figure about the accuracy of COVID-19 tests?\n\nA thorough review of prior research found: Using \"[rRT-PCR][1]; First-line screening tool: E gene assay; Confirmatory testing: RdRp gene assay.\" one can obtain \"95% detection probability, 100% specificity\".\n\nReference:\n\nThe Journal of Clinical Medicine review: \"[Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review][2]\", J.

It may be a complex combination of the two, which is why promoting lipolysis alone may not be beneficial.\n\n***\n\n**What are the therapeutic options?**\n\nThe current mainstay of therapy is symptomatic management, such as typical anti-epileptic drugs to control seizures.\n\nFrom [eMedicine][3]:\n> The only specific treatment available for neuronal ceroid\n> lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is cerliponase alfa (Brineura) for neuronal\n> ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2, also known as tripeptidyl\n> peptidase 1 [TPP1] deficiency).\n\nThis is a proenzyme, which is metabolised you an active enzyme that performs the function of the deficient enzyme.\n\nThere are several other possible therapeutic targets under research.\n\nOne protein of interest is [granulin][4]. It is produced from *progranulin*, which is encoded by the GRN gene. Interestingly, heterozygous mutations are associated with Frontotemporal Dementia, while homozygous mutations are associated with NCS.\n\n[This review paper][5] gives a detailed analysis of the current understanding of the many roles of progranulin in embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, inflammation, wound repair, neurodegeneration and lysosome function. It summarises the role of progranulin as a possible therapeutic option, which could be implemented using gene therapy.\n\n[This research paper][6] shows that gene therapy to replace deficient progranulin can help improve some of the clinical features, but the research was conducted on mice and not humans.\n\n***\n\nIn summary, the pathogenesis of NCS and associated disorders are complex. Treatment is more complex than simply trying to break down the accumulating lipofuscin. Instead, replacing the deficient enzyme would restore the lost function, instead of just removing the byproduct.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batten_disease\n  [2]: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/batten-disease-fact-sheet\n  [3]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1178391-medication#1\n  [4]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulin\n  [5]: https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awx198\n  [6]: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3081-17.2018", "20526": "The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is a summary of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) from [this source][1]:\n\n> Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, major, life-threatening\n> complication of diabetes characterised by hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis,\n> and ketonuria. \n> \n> It occurs when absolute or relative insulin deficiency inhibits the\n> ability of glucose to enter cells for utilisation as metabolic fuel,\n> the result being that the liver rapidly breaks down fat into ketones\n> to employ as a fuel source. The overproduction of ketones ensues,\n> causing them to accumulate in the blood and urine and turn the blood\n> acidic.\n\nHere is a visual summary of the pathogenesis of DKA, then from [this source][2].\n\n[![Pathogenesis of DKA][3]][3]\n\nYou can see that it is a complex process with many factors. DKA is more likely in a pro-inflammatory state, such as during an infection, which is a common trigger. It is a complex interplay between various factors resulting in disruption to carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism and results in fluid and electrolyte imbalance.\n\nEssentially the lack of insulin causes increased gluconeogenesis (production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein). The liver breaks down fat into ketones to use as an energy source, but these accumulate and alter the pH of the blood (this is the *ketoacidosis*). The rising glucose levels (due to gluconeogenesis and reduced utilisation of glucose) causes an [osmotic diuresis][4], resulting in loss of fluid, dehydration, renal impairment and then reduced ability for the kidneys to correct the electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n***\n\n**Oxaloacetate and acetyl coenzyme A**\n\nYou mention oxaloacetate and acetyl coenzyme A in your question. These biochemicals are part of the normal mechanism of cellular respiration (how cells produce energy). Disruption to their metabolism has a significant role to play in diabetic ketoacidosis. This is adapted from [Medscape][6]:\n\nKetones are produced from acetyl coenzyme A mainly in the mitochondria within hepatocytes (liver cells) when carbohydrate utilisation is impaired because of relative or absolute insulin deficiency, such that energy must be obtained from fatty acid metabolism. \n\n> High levels of acetyl coenzyme A present in the cell inhibit the\n> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, but pyruvate carboxylase is activated.\n> Thus, the oxaloacetate generated enters gluconeogenesis rather than\n> the citric acid cycle (also known as the Kreb\u2019s cycle) as the latter\n> is also inhibited by the elevated level of nicotinamide adenine\n> dinucleotide (NADH) resulting from excessive beta-oxidation of fatty\n> acids, another consequence of insulin resistance or insulin\n> deficiency.\n\nThe excess acetyl coenzyme A is therefore rerouted to ketogenesis, rather than the Kreb\u2019s cycle.\n\nAs a result, aerobic respiration is impaired and anaerobic respiration becomes predominant. This contributes to production of lactate as a by-product, which exacerbates the acidosis.\n\n***\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe question is not primarily about the treatment of DKA, but it is worth noting a brief overview. Treatment has the following aims:\n\n - Correction of dehydration Correction of acidosis and reverse ketosis\n   \n - Restoration of blood glucose to near normal levels\n\n - Monitor for complications of DKA and its treatment\n\n - Identify and treat any precipitating event\n\nHyperglycaemia is managed using insulin. Careful correction of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance is necessary, usually using intravenous fluids and electrolytes with frequent monitoring of blood electrolytes and pH (which must not be corrected too quickly).\n\n***\n\n**Sources**\n\n[eMedicine - Diabetic ketoacidosis][1]\n\n[Nyenwe, Kitabchi.

They found that taking zinc lozenges within 24 hours of first getting cold symptoms may reduce the length of the cold. They do not give any firm recommendation though, because of insufficient data. They also mention the same side-effects as above.<sup>[2]</sup> This study is also backed up by other similar study which found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by about 7 days, again with only minor side effects such as bad taste and mouth irritation.<sup>[3]</sup> Other similar reports' results showed that zinc lozenges not only reduce the duration of colds, but also the severity.<sup>[4], [5]</sup>\n\nSome studies say that zinc lozenges do not have any noteworthy therapeutic effect in treating the common cold.<sup>[6], [7]</sup>\n\n**Should you take zinc lozenges?**\n\nNo studies have provided sufficient information to prove or disprove beneficial effects of taking zinc lozenges to prevent and treat the common cold. The consumption of zinc lozenges doesn't present any dangerous or deadly effects, unless you consider bad taste and nausea deadly. As of now, experts recommend talking to your doctor to decide if taking zinc \nlozenges is right for you.<sup>[8]</sup>\n\n**What is the best type of zinc lozenge to take?**\n\nWell first, as I said above, there is no conclusive evidence. There is also no definite best type of zinc lozenge to take. Of the studies that showed positive results, zinc gluconate was used the most, but zinc sulfate and zinc acetate were also shown to be effective. Of the trials that showed no noteworthy effect, zinc gluconate was also the most tested type, but zinc acetate also showed no effect. According to [WebMD][9], researchers are still trying to figure out which type of zinc lozenge is the best.\n\n**Risks of taking zinc supplements**\n\nTaking zinc lozenges hasn't been shown to produce any major side-effects. Sometimes, people taking them may experience bad taste in their mouth and possibly nausea. Nasal spray, as you mentioned is also not good. It may even cause loss of smell.\n\n<!--References\n\n1 tums.ac.ir   \n2,3 wiley.com   \n4,5,6 nih.gov   \n7,8 asm.org  \n9 mayoclinic.org  -->\n\n----------\n\n<sup>[[1]]  [Effects of Zinc Supplementation in Occurrence and Duration of Common Cold in School Aged Children during Cold Season: a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial][1]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[2]]  [Zinc for the common cold][2]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[3]]  [Reduction in duration of common colds by zinc gluconate lozenges in a double-blind study][3]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[4]]  [Duration and severity of symptoms and levels of plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor, and adhesion molecules in patients with common cold treated with zinc acetate.][4]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[5]]  [Efficacy of zinc against common cold viruses: an overview.][5]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[6]]  [Two randomized controlled trials of zinc gluconate lozenge therapy of experimentally induced rhinovirus colds.][6] </sup>\n\n<sup>[[7]]  [Effect of treatment with zinc gluconate or zinc acetate on experimental and natural colds.][7]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[8]]  [Will taking zinc for colds make my colds go away faster?][8]</sup>\n\n<sup>[WebMD - Zinc for Colds: Lozenges & Nasal Sprays][9]</sup>\n\n\n  [1]: http://ijp.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijp/article/viewArticle/928\n  [2]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub4/abstract\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6367635\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279051?dopt=Abstract\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046?dopt=Abstract\n  [6]: http://aac.asm.org/content/31/8/1183.abstract?ijkey=c54e7d9e7cfc347b5eb4aca02fe68276ebe7863b&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11073753?dopt=Abstract\n  [8]: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/zinc-for-colds/faq-20057769\n  [9]: http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/zinc-lozenges-cold-remedy#2", "20379": "**You can't survive from the list of foods (mayonnaise, honey, beer, wine, oil and vinegar) in given amounts, because you can't get enough vitamin C.**\n\nIf I define \"survive\" as to live 10 years and remain healthy, then, in your scenario, which requires some *physical activity,* the ***minimal requirements*** (which can be much lower than Recommended Dietary Allowances) for adults:\n\n - **Calories:** 3,000\n - **Protein:** 35 g ([Metabolic Basis of Obesity][1])\n - **Fat:** 67 g (at least 20% of total calories) ([Nutrition Journal, 2017][2])\n - **Carbohydrates:** zero (theoretically), which also means zero fiber ([a meat diet study, 1930][3]).\n - **Water:** 2-3 liters\n - **Sodium:** ~1 g sodium, I guess; the minimal requirement is lower ([~200 mg][4]), but with sweating you need more.\n - **Vitamin C:** 10 mg - the *minimal* amount to prevent deficiency (scurvy) ([Office of Dietary Supplements][5])\n - **Iron:** 1.36 mg ([fao.org, p.198][6])\n - A certain amount of vitamins and minerals ([Recommended Dietary Allowances, NAP.edu][7]): minimal survival amounts would be likely less than 50% RDA.\n\nFrom the amount of foods you have, you can't survive, because the only source of vitamin C (1 kg of [honey][8] per person per day if they are 4 persons) would provide only 5 mg vitamin C and everyone needs at least 10 mg to avoid deficiency (scurvy).\n\nFrom other foods you have, everyone would barely get minimal (not recommended) amounts of protein and other nutrients, even when grossly exaggerating with calorie intake (> 5,000 - 6,000 Calories/day).\n\nHere are some calculations from already exaggerated amounts of foods (you have more available, but that's not realistic to consume):\n\n - 250 g [mayonnaise][9]: 1,700 Calories, 2.5 g protein, 187 g fat, 0.5 mg iron, 50 mg potassium, zero vitamin C\n - 1 kg (1/4 gallon) [honey][8]: 3,040 Calories, 3 g protein, 4 mg iron, 150 mg potassium, 5 mg vitamin C, \n - 4 liters (1 gallon) of [beer][10]: 1,720 Calories, 18 g protein, 0.4 mg iron, 1 g potassium, zero vitamin C\n - 1 liter (1/4 gallon) of [red wine][11]: 850 Calories, 1,3 g potassium, 4.6 mg iron, zero vitamin C\n - Oil and vinegar do not have significant amount of vitamins and minerals, so they do not help.\n\nSpoiler: You could easily get enough vitamin C from a [fruit juice][12] and protein and most other nutrients from [milk][13] (it can last some time even without refrigerator).

First, hypoplastic joints and soft tissue changes in the polydactylous and adjacent digits predispose to joint contracture and angular deformities. Second, delta phalanges predispose to progressive angular deformities. Third, joint contracture and rotatory deformities occur after extensive separation of complex osseous syndactyly, which may be further complicated by a disturbance of differentiation of tendons between affected digits (Fig. 3). **Our results show that the creation of a five-digit hand usually leads to poor functional results. Despite this, all parents were satisfied with the five-digit hand for cultural and religious reasons.** For the reconstruction of a functional hand, the most hypoplastic ray should be removed and a functional four-digit hand should be the object of the reconstruction surgery.   \n> <sub>\u2013\u2013 Koichi Tada et al.: [\"Central polydactyly \u2013 A review of 12 cases and their surgical treatment\"][1], The Journal of Hand Surgery, Vol 7, No.5 September 1982.</sub>\n\n\nAnd an 'uncorrected' 24 digit owner from India being a wrestler in his youth:\n\n>  Local examination showed extra digits in all 4 limits So total, he had 12 fingers in his upper limbs (6 in each ) and 12 toes in his lower limbs (6 in each).

Whether surgical alterations are indeed a functional improvement seems not always to be the case. But it seems rarest to encounter any FFFFP patient which had his/her extra-limbs tolerated and trained, for example for a complicated instrument like a piano, to get at any observation that would be worth generalising. But as long as the mechanics of the digits are indeed independently functional, I am quite convinced the brain would be adaptable to that situation.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363502382800403\n  [2]: http://ijcrr.com/uploads/1471_pdf.pdf\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650481", "19482": "The NHS page you linked to does quite a good job of explaining why the study that puts forward the claim that there *isn't* a link doesn't actually quite say that with any degree of certainty. They are a bit wishy-washy about it and the British Heart Foundation takes a somewhat [tougher stance](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/behind-the-headlines/cholesterol-and-statins)\n\nLDL cholesterol (LDL-C), along with other types of cholesterol are widely upheld to be **risk factors** for cardiovascular disease as opposed to being the \"one true cause\" and there is very good evidence to suggest that reducing LDL-C levels in the bloodstream reduces the cardiovascular risk of an individual:\n\n[![Figure 3 from: Association Between Lowering LDL-C and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Among Different Therapeutic Interventions A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis JAMA. 2016;316(12):1289-1297.][1]][1]\n\n[Figure 3 from: Association Between Lowering LDL-C and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Among Different Therapeutic Interventions A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis JAMA. 2016;316(12):1289-1297.](https://mfprac.com/web2018/07literature/literature/Cardiology/StatinsHead_Silverman.pdf)\n\nThe above graph shows a noticeable *decrease* in the risk of a cardiovascular event when the LDL-C levels are reduced - now it's important to note that correlation is not the same thing as causation. So we can't say for sure that lowering the LDL-C was definitively responsible for the reduction in risk, but it does indicate that as the LDL-C level lowers so does the risk.\n\nA [study carried out in 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2988224/) also seems to indicate that as the level of reduction is increased the risk decreases further:\n\n>\u2026 similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied \u2026\n\nThis study was mainly looking at statin use vs. control but as per the *Silverman et al* paper shows the reduction in risk varies depending on the *mechanism* for reducing the LDL-C used \u2013 which suggests that LDL-C level alone doesn't control cardiovascular event risk but that there is an indication of a link.\n\nCrucially this correlation seems consistently to be in the opposite direction to what the *Rvanskov  et al* study claims.\n\nIt's generally accepted that there are of course [other risk factors](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-heart-disease/causes/) besides LDL-C in determining the risk of a cardiac event \u2013 smoking, lack of exercise, diabetes, obesity, genetic predisposition etc. And of course it's quite feasible to have more than one of these factors working together to increase the risk levels to the point where a heart attack happens.\n\nFor some reason the so-called \"cholesterol controversy\" seems to persist \u2013 and it's a particular hobby-horse of more than one of the authors of the paper in question. At least two of whom have written books about the theory (primary author [Uffe Rvanskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffe_Ravnskov) and  [Malcolm Kendrick][2])\n and 9 are members of a lobbyist organisation on the subject \u2013 \"The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics\" (\"THINCS\") which is a strong indicator of bias, and that the authors might be looking for results that supported the conclusion they already had.\n\nBias alone does not necessarily mean a study is inherently bad or wrong but there's other warning signs as well, the paper is is what is called a [Narrative review](https://www.nhs.uk/news/health-news-glossary/#narrativereview) where the paper is structured as a narrative, in other words they are discussing and presenting a story rather than presenting a statistical analysis of the data (such as a meta-analysis).\n\nIn this case they are describing what they found when they did a certain search on PubMed (an on-line searchable database of medical publications) \u2013 and they describe which keywords they used and what exclusions they made. One such search criteria was \"NOT trial\" \u2013 so clinical trials would be excluded from their search.\n\nThis is worrying when the later in the paper they say the following:\n\n>It is worth considering that some of the participants with high LDL-C may have started statin treatment during the observation period. Such treatment may have increased the lifespan for the group with high LDL-C. However, any beneficial effects of statins on mortality would have been minimal because most statin trials have had little effect on CVD and all-cause mortality, with a maximum reduction of mortality of two percentage points.\n\nHere the authors make an assertion regarding the efficacy of statins in reducing mortality and cite that they have \"little effect\" and a \"maximum reduction of mortality of two percentage points\", except they don't cite any such study, and they have **explicitly** excluded statin trials from their search criteria. We are expected to believe this statement simply because the authors say it is so.\n\nThe closest the Rvanskov paper comes to directly addressing this is near the end where they state:\n\n>Our review provides the basis for more research about the cause of atherosclerosis and CVD and also for a re-evaluation of the guidelines for cardiovascular prevention, in particular because the benefits from statin treatment have been exaggerated.\n\nAnd they list three citations for this statement - one is *another* Rvanskov paper (self-cites don't carry a great deal of weight IMO), a bombastic paper written by another member of THINCS and the *Kristensen et al* paper which analysed death postponement values during statin trials. The conclusion of that paper makes the fairly unequivocal statement that:\n\n>Statins are usually inexpensive and safe, at least in a clinical trial setting, and the benefit in terms of mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes cannot reasonably be challenged.\n\nSo in summary this paper from *Rvanskov el al* doesn't seem to offer much in the way of strong research and if anything shows strong indicators of bias and IMO it's hard to take it seriously. \n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZznC.jpg\n  [2]: https://www.google.com/search?q=The%20Great%20Cholesterol%20Con%3A%20The%20Truth%20About%20What%20Really%20Causes%20Heart%20Disease%20and%20How%20to%20Avoid%20It%20Malcolm%20Kendrick", "19455": "Examples of accidents in which the described injuries can occur:\n\n - Falling from the height (>4 m) on the hard surface, especially when trying to ease the impact with the hands (Here's one military report of [parachuting accidents][1] with detailed list of injuries in Table 4)\n - Falling down a steep slope, such as in the mountains, and hitting rocks on the way down and at the bottom\n - The car slipping from the road and rolling down the hill; the person does not use a security belt\n - [A pedestrian being hit by a car][2] (detailed injury description)\n - Driving a car without using a security belt and without having an air bag and being involved in a head-on collision with another car\n - Getting hit by the train when crossing the railway by a car\n - Falling in the river (from the boat, banks or bridge) and then being rolled over the rocks in the rapids\n\nFalling from the bridge into a deep water as such may not necessary cause all those exact injuries, especially not in the hands and fingers.\n\n  [1]: https://watermark.silverchair.com/49-1-17.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAApYwggKSBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKDMIICfwIBADCCAngGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMcxTUvxUC8haftPItAgEQgIICSUGSHiIZOYHURR10rXFPubpCxJmWwdjkxIpZa6jR7aaFiJeC4rEAlLF254bzDxiu2ygfY67BwB-vXPXyFiAx4hgm3kf2oFEvjvstHttEWb-oAcdlyt-KXnHxZtNbY8IZ1MR9u_nMrd1Ts0wwMakbrLQNNemJJXF6XMTUZN6B97LbjWQdU3SMRKBduK5fPgpkGFExXPWK9ehm7CQSGlAIq1m-sRwSseLB-PcWSI46PQxpyD793-qdYEgYcdrr30J_h5YAflt5bj0q_IoLHmRck8DKlIjFL2j2badC8Gnke3KfQzOG8FJq-yKhZs_wM4LX6amIaUEdNL9oPNtQElu3U6BJbPDQCPtoi1pBruRYK-Q4ABd1tOIAcKp7_dTM96DIiWVu-JZCWt0tveyEk9zPyqkex0NY19SDfmQmoCiAWMM8kq5NiHullEkzIGRHs02DG9-OZF9ZqRdBpYRm0aPNrn_WaI_17Nofaf_lST9Lzxyb1xmBNUJaF2ilc-Mr-mnC569H6AbtO4kV073nO1HM1rhixeujzTZ1kOr9grA3o7h7kowWRknzidFYRgs1V5s7oWx51HIkO-PzB6kr1IyTBQQXKtldF-bGlOYSQ2HG8jSCFzvsSWDX7BbaD6QZHBvIaRjaEdl6Vmp6nuKGVsffWTzOcEYqLQ3elKf4L_PvREOzcKVw11yzBeREIivU-rGKG6gMT3v5U0tNBWajas_e-LGjsLq3AK_oQI-FjznAtWWXcDO4IVBn1hGefGgVr1IR2wo0kCwLGqmTZA\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256841/", "19442": "Flatulence, which is likely associated with abdominal distention and thus some discomfort, can disturb sleep.\n\nSources:\n\n - Functional Abdominal Bloating with Distention ([ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2012][1]) \n - Tips for a Quiet Tummy, Restful Sleep ([WebMD][2])\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388350/\n  [2]: https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/indigestion-sleep#1", "19335": "Assuming you are *healthy*, you will likely naturally regulate your sodium intake to appropriate levels.\u2002(Sodium is highly regulated by the [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system][12].)\u2002Too low and too high are both possible, and I would *not* attempt to manipulate sodium intake without without measuring or calculating current intake first.\n\nIf you are thirsty, you are either not getting enough water or eating too much salt.\u2002If you are craving salty foods, you're either drinking too much or not eating enough salt.\u2002Excessively high or low salt intake over long periods of time alters RAAS activity (otherwise serum sodium levels would be affected), so changes should be made gradually.\u2002**Before making significant changes to your diet, you should consult your physician.**\n\n----\n\nDecreasing salt intake had been recommended to decrease blood pressure.\u2002In \"Why Should I Limit Sodium?\" ([pdf][1]), The American Heart Association states:\n\n> Having less sodium in your diet may help you lower or avoid high blood pressure.

But there are some pointers which I'll outline below. \n\nIn [2] the authors state that \"Both folic acid (FA) and folinic acid (FLN) supplements have been shown to reduce the toxicity of MTX [...] and may prevent the formation of the less effective metabolite 7-hydroxy-MTX\".\n\nIn [3] the authors state that \"Methotrexate is a competitive antagonist of folic acid. It inhibits dihydrofolate reductase with resultant interference of DNA synthesis leading to apoptosis.\" They also state \"inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is not presumed to be the primary mediator [of efficacy] as supplementation with folic acid does not reduce the clinical efficacy\"\n\nIn summary, methotrexate inhibits cancer growth by other unknown mechanisms than just preventing DNA synthesis by competing for folic acid uptake. Folic acid supplementation only reduces the effect of the latter. In addition, the speed at which cancer cells divide when compared to normal cells may skew the folic acid vs methotrexate uptake antagonism in a way that makes folic acid supplementation more beneficial for healthy cells than cancer cells.\n\nAs for your other question in the title \"why doesn't folic acid supplementation make cancer tumours grow\", I assume you mean why supplementation in it's own right doesn't make them grow. This is because the rate at which cancer grows is limited by a whole range of factors including many different nutrients like oxygen, water and many others. Increasing folic acid would be only one of the nutrients it needs.\n\n[1] : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8608361\n\n[2] : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21044441\n\n[3] : T. Bayless, S.

They do not change any part of the eye itself. Wearing glasses that are too strong or otherwise wrong for the eyes cannot harm an adult's, although it might result in a temporary headache. At worse, the glasses will fail to correct vision and make the wearer uncomfortable because of blurriness, but no damage to any part of the eye will result.\n\nThe use of so called *anti-corrective* lenses is a topic of discussion in many blogs but I would heed caution on taking advice from blogs.\n\nThere have been scientific studies on \"undercorrection\" of myopia in children ([Chung, et al. 2002][6]) which found that it enhances rather than inhibits myopia progression.\n\n##How to slow down, and *maybe* halt progression of myopia\n\nIf you use computer screens over a long period each day, especially if you do so as part of your job, wearing the correct prescribed eyewear would be the best thing to do.\n\nEmployers must provide and pay for eyesight tests and any resulting prescription where requested by the employer in law under the [Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992][7] here in the UK, and in the European Union under [Council Directive 90/270/EEC of 29 May 1990][8].  Employers must also ensure that employees take regular and adequate breaks from looking at their screens.\n\nThis applies whether you work at home, hotdesk at different locations or workstations, or work at a fixed workstation.\n\nThe [Heath and Safety Executive website][9] points out that\n\n>The law says employers must arrange an eye test for\u00a0display screen equipment (DSE) users\u00a0if they ask for one, and provide glasses if an employee needs them only for DSE use.\nDSE work does not cause permanent damage to eyes. But long spells of DSE work can lead to:\n>\n- tired eyes\n- discomfort \n- temporary short-sightedness\n- headaches\n>\nDSE work is visually demanding, so it can make someone aware of eyesight problems they have not noticed before (including changes in eyesight that happen with age).\n>\nEmployees can help their eyes by:\n>\n- checking the screen is well positioned and properly adjusted\n- making sure lighting conditions are suitable\n- taking regular breaks from screen work\n\nMore can be read on this via the main page at http://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/dse\n\n##References\n\nChung, K., Mohidin, N., & O\u2019Leary, D.

Goals are stopping the hemorrhage, delivering the baby, and repairing the uterus if possible. \n\nThe range of risks is similar to the range of risks of a cesarean delivery (infection, blood loss, thromboembolism, hysterectomy, organ injury, adhesions, extended hospital stay, extended recovery time, risks associated with anesthesia, maternal mortality, fetal injury, fetal respiratory problems, fetal neurological problems, and perinatal death, see Williams Obstetrics). Single center reports vary, due in part to the characteristics of their patient population, so it is difficult to pin down a useful rate for comparison, but generally the risks would seem to be higher. A [population level study  in Canada](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1216316/) looking at all maternal morbidity from 1991 - 2001, reported 4 total cases of maternal death after uterine rupture in those 10 years, from which we can calculate a risk of 2 per 1,000 uterine ruptures. This is much higher than with cesarean (varies, but, Williams puts it at 2.2 per 100,000, and with a comparable population the risk of maternal mortality after vaginal delivery is 0.2 per 100,000), but the [2010 NIH consensus statement on VBAC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20502301) states there have been no reported maternal deaths due to uterine rupture, presumably using US data alone.\n\nOther than maternal mortality, the primary risks of uterine rupture are hysterectomy (14-33 percent) and perinatal death (6 percent) (see the NIH consensus statement).\n\nI would note, also, the risk of uterine rupture is reported and probably presented when discussing VBAC, as less than 1%, but the specific risk is highly dependent on specific maternal and uterine characteristics. A classic (vertical) cesarean incision (which is generally not done anymore), for example, carries a higher risk than a low transverse incision, and a poor closure (single-layer) also carries a higher risk. Much of what drives the reported risk of uterine rupture during TOLAC is based on surgical techniques from many decades ago.

If avoiding lactose alleviates your symptoms, you've potentially treated your primary lactose intolerance successfully. If you feel somewhat better but still experience classic GI problems (bloating, diarrhea), you might be lactose intolerant secondary to a [different illness](http://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=09647058-201512-201512310024-201512310024-s9-s13) like Crohn's disease or celiac disease. Keep in mind, lactose intolerance is caused by the lack of an enzyme (lactase) in your body, so lactose can't be digested \u2013 a milk allergy is your body generating an immune response to certain milk proteins, but doesn't suggest any enzymatic deficit.\n\nUsually, your physician will perform a [hydrogen breath test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4175689/#Sec3title) to confirm a lactose intolerance diagnosis. When you're missing the lactase enzyme, you can't digest lactose (which means you can't absorb lactose, since it's \"too big\" pre-digestion \u2013 this and energy release are the goals of catabolism). This results in lactose sitting around post-consumption (there are no enzymes available to cleave it for transport), where it starts to ferment in your gut microbiota. Bacterial digestion like this makes degradation products like methane, carbon dioxide, and *hydrogen* (this is where the name \"hydrogen breath test\" comes from), and we can measure these gases as they rise to escape from your GI tract.

Alternatively, [fecal pH tests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00365529409091742) can be used to show GI irregularities like lactose intolerance (malabsorption makes your stool acidic).

This is due to a number of factors:\n\n* Solubility. Water-soluble nutrients (like Vitamin B, C) are highly prone to leach out if cooking in water<sup>[2]</sup> (boiling, for example). Fat-soluble nutrients are at a similar risk when cooking in a fat medium or when the fat is lost in the process (e.g., frying, grilling)<sup>[5]</sup>.\n\n* Heat. Both fat- and water-soluble nutrients are susceptible to heat from any cooking source, while mineral nutrients are less so<sup>[5]</sup>. \n\n* Duration. Methods with shorter cook times (e.g., stir-frying, blanching, microwaving) reduce the effects of heat degradation because the food is not exposed to heat for as long<sup>[5]</sup>.\n\n(It's not even always a loss: some nutrients are *more* available after cooking, because heat breaks down thick cell walls that our digestive system has trouble with, which means that the nutrients are easier for our bodies to uptake<sup>[3]</sup>.)\n\nEach cooking method has a **different combination** of the above factors, and so has different effects on nutrients in food. Microwave cooking has the advantage of not cooking in water, and being able to reach a higher heat in a shorter time. Depending on the food, this means that microwaving is sometimes *better* at preserving nutrients. For example, boiling spinach causes a much higher loss (77% vs. almost none) of [folate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid) compared to microwaving<sup>[4]</sup>.\n\nOf course, when people make claims about microwaved food being less healthy, they are *usually* referring to a fear that the act of microwave heating ([dielectric heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating#Microwave_heating)) is 'unnatural' in some way, or is subjecting the food to dangerous radiation (which may then be ingested). This is simply not supported<sup>[9]</sup> by scientific literature, which indicates that microwave ovens, when used properly, are safe and effective -- with **two caveats**:\n\n* Human milk. The CDC<sup>[6]</sup> does not recommend heating human milk in the microwave, because of the risk of uneven heating of the liquid (which could scald a baby), and because there is some evidence<sup>[7]</sup> that it decreases its anti-infective properties.\n\n* Superheating of liquids. If water is heated in a microwave in a smooth container, it can pose a risk of scalding due to superheating<sup>[9]</sup>. From [wikipedia][8]:\n> Superheating can occur when an undisturbed container of water is heated in a microwave oven. When the container is removed, the water still appears to be below the boiling point. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling water out of the container. [...] There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.\n\nIn conclusion, microwaving food is a safe alternative to cooking via other methods<sup>[9]</sup>. Any cooking method will decrease the nutritional value of food, but this is usually an acceptable tradeoff because of the benefits gained from cooking<sup>[5]</sup>. Microwaves do not cause food to be radioactive or acutely dangerous in any way.\n\n### References\n\n1. [Does Cooking Food Reduce the Vitamin Content?][1] - SFGate\n1.

DOI: [10.1021/es5036333][2]\n\n> Tobacco smoke residues lingering in the indoor environment, also termed thirdhand smoke (THS), can be a source of long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. THS composition is affected by chemical transformations and by air\u2013surface partitioning over time scales of minutes to months. This study identified and quantified airborne THS pollutants available for respiratory exposure, identified potential environmental tracers, and estimated health impacts to nonsmokers. In a ventilated 18m<sup>3</sup> laboratory chamber, six cigarettes were machine-smoked, and levels of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and 58 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored during an aging period of 18h. Results were compared with field measurements taken in a smoker\u2019s home 8h after the last cigarette had been smoked. Initial chamber levels of individual VOCs in freshly emitted secondhand smoke (SHS) were in the range of 1\u2013300 \u03bcg m<sup>\u20133</sup>. The commonly used SHS tracers 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) and nicotine were no longer present in the gas phase after 2 h, likely due mostly to sorption to surfaces. By contrast, other VOCs persisted in the gas phase for at least 18 h, particularly furans, carbonyls, and nitriles. The concentration ratio of acetonitrile to 3-EP increased substantially with aging. This ratio may provide a useful metric for differentiating freshly emitted (SHS) from aged smoke (THS). Among the 29 VOCs detected in the smoker\u2019s home at moderate to high concentrations, 18 compounds were also detected in simultaneously sampled outdoor air, but acetonitrile, 2-methyl furan, and 2,5-dimethyl furan appeared to be specific to cigarette smoke. The levels of acrolein, methacrolein, and acrylonitrile exceeded concentrations considered harmful by the State of California. An initial exposure and impact assessment was conducted for a subset of pollutants by computing disability-adjusted life years lost, using available toxicological and epidemiological information. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u00a0contributed to more than 90% of the predicted harm. Acrolein, furan, acrylonitrile, and 1,3-butadiene were considered to be the most harmful VOCs. Depending on which criteria are used to establish the separation between SHS and THS, 5\u201360% of the predicted health damage could be attributed to THS exposure. Benefits and limitations of this approach are discussed.\n\nRam\u00edrez, N., \u00d6zel, M. Z., Lewis, A. C., Marc\u00e9, R. M., Borrull, F., & Hamilton, J. F. (2014).

Using a highly sensitive and selective analytical approach we have determined the presence of nicotine, eight N-nitrosamines and five tobacco-specific nitrosamines in forty-six settled dust samples from homes occupied by both smokers and non-smokers. Using observations of house dust composition, we have estimated the cancer risk by applying the most recent official toxicological information. Calculated cancer risks through exposure to the observed levels of TSNAs at an early life stage (1 to 6\u00a0years old) exceeded the upper-bound risk recommended by the USEPA in 77% of smokers' and 64% of non-smokers' homes. The maximum risk from exposure to all nitrosamines measured in a smoker occupied home was one excess cancer case per one thousand population exposed.\n\n\n  [1]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.06.012\n  [2]: https://doi.org/10.1021/es5036333", "16242": "I have found no credible source that would mention \"maximum recommended daily amount of full fat milk.\" \n\n[MedlinePlus][1]:\n\n> The US Department of Agriculture recommends the following daily\n> amounts of dairy for children and teens:\n> \n>  - Two through 3 years old: 2 cups (480 milliliters)\n>  - Four through 8 years old: 2\u00bd cups (600 milliliters)\n>  - Nine through 18 years old: 3 cups (720 milliliters)\n\nA 12 year old boy drinking 1.5 US pints (710 milliliters) of milk fits in.\n\nRegarding the concern that milk can make blood acidic: The acidogenic effect of foods can be estimated by \"renal acid load\" (the amount of acids secreted through the kidneys).

Eradicating this natural habitat on a large scale is very likely too destructive and radical for the lice to adapt quickly enough to such a new situation.\n\n\nBut there is also a problem:\n> [**Apes, lice and prehistory** (2009)][1]  \n> Head and body lice used to be designated Pediculus capitis and P. corporis but they are now known to belong to the same species, P. humanus x. Fifty years ago Levene and Dobzhansky showed that head lice could be trained or adapted to become the rather larger body lice by attaching them to the body in small pill boxes.\n> More extensive phylogenetic analyses [16,17] indicate that body lice evolved from head lice several times within the worldwide clade A, as they are found in many branches of the cladisitic tree. Multiple derivations of body lice from head lice had already been considered by Zinsser [1], and it makes good sense if one considers that clothing was not a single invention. Wearing animal pelts fur-side next to the skin would have provided a suitable place for lice to breed before fabrics were developed with the inventions of spinning and weaving.\n>\n> In 17th and 18th century Europe, most of the aristocracy and gentry shaved their hair and wore wigs. Had this custom arisen to protect them from lice as Zinsser  suggests? Not according to Samuel Pepys' diary, as he complained more than once about his wig being infested: \"Thence to my barbers, to have my periwig cleared of its nits.\" I wonder if they were head or body lice \u2013 is a wig hair or clothing?\n>\n> **Lice and nudity**\nWhy naked apes are naked and when we 'lost' our hair has long been disputed, as discussed by Desmond Morris in The Naked Ape. Rantala suggested that nakedness could have had a selective advantage to rid the body of lice and other ectoparasites, a view also championed by Pagel and Bodmer, who added that being seen to be free of lice would be a fitness indicator and a good mating strategy. \n\n\nThese little parasites are highly adaptable and while not that robust in general, the amount of fibre, fabric or hair they need to breed is really minimal.\n\n> [**Shaving can be safer head lice treatment than insecticides**][2] (2005)   \n> Sladden and Johnson reviewed common skin infections in children.1 The life cycle of head lice (Pediculosis capitis) was well described and is similar to that of pubic lice. I worked in chronic emergencies in Somalia in 1993 and Sudan 1996-7 among internally displaced populations and in the nomadic Karimajong of Uganda in 1998-9, whose poor hygiene would have been a good breeding ground for head lice. However, head lice were never a clinical problem because these populations know how to interrupt its lifecycle: they shave off their hair, the only place where the eggs (nits) are anchored and glued close to the skin. Lice outside the hair are not transmissible and do not cause infestation.\n\nIt is therefore likely that we might be able to not only reduce the lice problem, but to eradicate them completely. But only by going naked and *really*\nhairless.\n\n\n> [**Pubic lice: an endangered species?**][3] (2014)  \n> The incidence of pubic lice infestations is estimated to be between 1.3% and 4.6%, with an average incidence of 2% worldwide. It is also estimated that 70% to 80% of adults now remove pubic hair in part or entirety, using a variety of methods. It is hypothesized that the destruction of this pubic hair habitat may account for the falling incidence of pubic lice and may possibly lead to its eradication or atypical presentation.   \n**Aim:**  To report the changing incidence of pubic lice infestation from our unit over the last 10 years and assess its association, if any, with pubic hair removal of any kind.   \n**Methods:** Assessment of medical records and questionnaires were used to identify the incidence of hair removal and pubic lice infestation over a 10-year period. Data were anonymized and analyzed to identify any correlation.  \n**Results:** A significant and strong correlation between the falling incidence of pubic lice infections and increase in pubic hair removal was observed, with a Pearson correlation r value of 0.9686 (95% confidence intervals, 0.88-0.992). The P value is less than 0.0001.   \n**Conclusions:**   The increased incidence of hair removal may lead to atypical patterns of pubic lice infestations or its complete eradication as the natural habitat of this parasite is destroyed.\n\n\nThat seems to be the future.

According to '[Bioengineering In Wound Healing: A Systems Approach](https://books.google.com/books?id=m_etDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA48&ots=IlPeqkIMJm&dq=normotrophic%20scar%20healing&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q=normotrophic%20scar%20healing&f=false),'\n\n> These processes include coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibropalacia, epithelization, contraction, and remodeling.\n\nWound healing is not always a linear process, as it depends on multiple local, system, and environmental characteristics. When the healed wound completely restores the anatomy and function of the initial tissue, \n\n> the regeneration is complete and scarless. \n\nHowever, fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration are not favorable in mammals. \n\n> \u2026the wound must close fast to enable survival and thus, in most cases in mammals, a tick fibrous tissue \u2014 a scar \u2014 is formed at the injured site.\n\nAlthough several systemic and genomic studies have identified potential cellular and extracellular factors that mediate the formation of scars, the exact mechanism that induces proliferative scar tissue formation instead of healthy tissue is unknown.\n\n> Current data show that alterations in coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, contraction, remodeling, mechanical tension correlate with the formation of scars.\n\nInflammation plays an important role in the body\u2019s response to the injury and in all stages of wound healing.\n\n> The inflammatory response includes the response of local inflammatory cells and recruitment of inflammatory cells from the circulation.\n\nMultiple studies show that inflammation continues to play a critical role in wound remodeling,\n\n> \u2026probably leading to scar formation.\n\nWounds create damage at the system\u2019s protective layer and provides a new, nutrient rich ground for microorganisms.\n\n> Microbiota play a role in both wound-healing abnormalities: chronic, non-healing wounds and hypertrophic scars, and also healing improvement.\n\nAdvances in molecular biology have allowed for an improved understanding of wound healing.\n\n> For optimal healing, complex molecular processes must be appropriate and precise.\n\nThe depth of injury is of particular interest as it determines if a wound heals with scarring or not. \n\n> Injury that is restricted to the epidermis is referred to as an erosion; if the injury were to go deeper, involving the dermis, then it is referred to as an ulcer\u2026Erosions heal without scar, while dermal injury often heals with scar.\n\nMany factors influence the time needed for a wound to heal\u2026\n\n>\u2026by secondary intention: wound depth (i.e. deeper wounds take longer than shallow wounds), anatomic location (e.g. concave surfaces do better than convex surfaces), vascular supply, shape (I.e. the narrower the diameter, the faster the closure), underlying comorbidities (e.g. Diabetes, tobacco use), and secondary infection...the balance between degradation and synthesis determines if a scar will be normal or abnormal. \n\nYour \"normotrophic\" scar type is said to cause the least harm and typically forms as a result of an adequate reaction of the body to an injury. A chapter on Normotrophic Scars in the \u2018[Atlas of Scar Treatment and Correction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-29196-8_3)\u2019 states the following,\n\n> If the wound passes all stages of cicatrization without deviations, a normotrophic scar is formed. **In time, such scars become level with the skin, assume a whitish color, become thin, and do not pose any physical discomfort to their bearers. Normally, they do not require correction except for aesthetic improvement of the scar appearance, its surface effacement, and acceleration of the color normalization process**.\n\n**What vitamins (dietary supplements or some other substances) for internal taking will be useful for the skin?** \n\nThere isn't one specific vitamin, supplement, or \"some other substance\" that is useful for the skin. However, your nutritional status in general can greatly influence wound healing, as wounds increase the energy, vitamin, mineral, and protein requirements necessary to promote healing. In fact, without adequate nutrition, the process of wound healing can actually be negatively impacted. \n\nAccording to \u2018[Nutrition\u00a0in\u00a0Wound\u00a0Care Management: A Comprehensive Overview.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27447105)\u2019 \n\n> The role of nutrition in wound healing may be overlooked in the wound care patient\u2026it is often multifaceted, with many\u00a0nutritional\u00a0components playing a variety of roles in the\u00a0wound healing\u00a0process. **Suboptimal\u00a0nutrition\u00a0can alter immune function, collagen synthesis, and\u00a0wound\u00a0tensile strength, all of which are essential in the\u00a0wound healing\u00a0process.**\n\nThe above abstract determined that *nutrition is a common denominator for all wound patients*, regardless of the type of wound. In summary,\n\n> \u2026it appears that some nutrients are necessary only if deficient, whereas others may become conditionally essential and serve a therapeutic role. \n\nNutrition also influences *skin structure*. An abstract titled \u2018[The Effects of Dietary Macronutrient Balance on Skin Structure in Aging Male and Female Mice.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832138)\u2019 evaluated the associations between macronutrients, energy intake, and skin structure in mice.\n\n> We evaluated the associations between macronutrients, energy intake and skin structure in mice fed 25 experimental diets and a control diet for 15 months using the Geometric Framework, a novel method of\u00a0nutritional\u00a0analysis.\n\nSkin structure was associated with the *ratio of dietary macronutrients eaten* and the nature of the effect differed between the sexes.\n\n> **In males, skin structure was primarily associated with protein intake**, whereas **in females carbohydrate intake was the primary correlate**. In both sexes, the dermis and subcutaneous fat thicknesses were inversely proportional. Subcutaneous fat thickness varied positively with fat intake, due to enlarged adipocytes rather than increased adipocyte number. We therefore demonstrated clear interactions between skin structure and macronutrient intakes, with the associations being sex-specific and dependent on dietary macronutrient balance.\n\nAn abstract on '[Nutrition and Chronic Wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217039/)' discusses nutrition as related to the patient with chronic wounds. The review provides knowledge of basic nutrition, the epidemiology of malnutrition in the chronic wound patient, and how to screen patients for malnutrition. It also recognizes that\n\n> \u2026even obese patients may suffer from protein and micronutrient malnutrition.\u00a0\n\n**Macronutrients are discussed in detail:**\n\n> Macronutrients are defined by ASPEN Guidelines and Standards as \u201c**nutrients present in the body and required in the greatest amount (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids).\u201d** Amino acids are the building blocks of protein throughout the body. Some individual amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and methionine) have been supplemented in addition to the protein in the diet as adjunct pharmacologic nutrients for wound healing. Carbohydrates may be used to provide carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis but only for those amino acids that are nutritionally dispensable (nonessential). Indispensible (essential) amino acids must be provided in the diet as a component of protein fed or as a keto-acid for all indispensible amino acids except lysine, threonine, and histidine. Fatty acids and cholesterol are nutrients that can be catabolized via beta oxidation to form cellular energy (ATP) and have important cellular functionality such as insulating membranes for nerve axons and are also necessary to form the lipid bilayer essential for organelle and cell membranes. \n\n**Micronutrients are also discussed in detail:**\n\n> **Micronutrients are defined as \u201cnutrients present and required in the body in minute quantities (e.g., vitamins, trace elements).\u201d** Micronutrients include the vitamins and certain minerals. These minerals are often referred to as trace elements. Certain minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus (macrominerals), which are present in large quantities in the bone and other tissues, are not considered trace elements. One of the most common functions of micronutrients, and some macrominerals, is to serve as necessary cofactors for enzymatic reactions. Essential (or indispensable) nutrients are those that cannot be synthesized in the body, such as vitamin C and minerals.\u00a0\n\n'[Nutrition Basics](https://mynutrition.wsu.edu/nutrition-basics/)' by Washington State University, outlines specifics related to macro- and micronutrients including role in the body, recommended daily allowance, and food sources. This might be a useful resource in determining appropriate macro- and micronutrient related food choices that may promote wound healing and possibly reduce the appearance of scarring.\n\nAdditionally, '[The importance of patients\u2019 nutritional status in wound healing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12070399/),' concurs,\n\n> **Wound healing\u00a0is dependent on good\u00a0nutrition\u00a0and the presence of suitable polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet.** Protein deficiency has been demonstrated to contribute to poor\u00a0healing\u00a0rates with reduced collagen formation and\u00a0wound\u00a0dehiscence. High exudate loss can result in a deficit of as much as 100g of protein in one day. This subsequently needs to be replaced with a **high protein diet**. **Vitamins are also important in\u00a0wound healing**. Vitamin C deficiency contributes to fragile granulation tissue.\u00a0\n\nAlthough it is possible that you may not achieve complete scar prevention, the information described above may provide some insight about the role of nutrition in wound healing and scar appearance.

Only when using the same plant for different preparations you might reason that [grass][5] is just dried and cured flowers (with a concentration of molecules as produced by nature), [hashish][13] is then a 'step up' with higher concentration (but with roughly the same ratio of chemicals from the [trichomes][14]) and [oil][15] as the highest concentration (made through a highly chemical extraction process).\n\nSo, there is not really much of a difference (assuming e.g. that with oil there are no solvents left in the finished product): \n\n- It is depends on the source material\n- It depends on the quality standard of preparation\n- It depends on the amount of active chemicals delivered, their ratio to one another, the route, and speed of uptake\n\n---\n\nIt seems necessary to add that \n\n1.

To mitigate these unwanted effects of THC (and other cannabinoids working like this) a certain level of CBD is needed. While CBD will not be making you \"high\", it is *technically* [psychoactive][18] in having (among others) a certain relaxing effect and more importantly modulating the effect of THC. They work synergistically.\n3. Returning to the problem of [overdose][19]: eating and drinking are slower to set on \u2013 smoking, vaporising have a faster onset. But with inhaling the effects are usually  felt within seconds compared to up to hours when ingesting the material. That means a user smoking can stop much sooner once she approaches or oversteps hers limits. Eating on the other hand needs very careful testing and dosing: once is is swallowed then that is the ride you booked and paid for, no refunds. And that brings us back to oil extracts. Smoking oil, made from fairly THC rich material to begin with or ending up that way, might overwhelm you on the first draw.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986974\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915313\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28120229\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875990\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cannabis_foods\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cannabis_smoking\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichome\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_oil\n  [16]: https://www.rxlist.com/marinol-side-effects-drug-center.htm\n  [17]: https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8774-1840/dronabinol-oral/dronabinol-solution-oral/details#side-effects\n  [18]: https://herb.co/2017/03/24/cbd-psychoactive/\n  [19]: https://www.projectknow.com/research/marijuana-overdose/", "13754": "About sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), the ingestion of 1-2 SSB  daily increment the caries incidence at least in 31% ([Source][1])\n\nThe use of carbonate drinks without sugar added increase the incidence of dental erosion ([source][2]). \n\nHence, any carbonated liquid is associated with dental erosion.

Neither of these *eliminate* deafness, but can restore a significant amount of functional hearing. The auditory system is described as having thousands of channels  while a cochlear implant has a dozen or so. Hearing aids simply turn up the volume so other channels can detect the sound, but there are still missing/damaged channels.\n\nThis is also research into [hair cell regeneration](http://www.cochlea.org/en/future-cures) that could repair some types of damage to the inner ear. While the research looks promising, it is technically difficult. You have to regrow the hair cell in the correct location with the right orientation and size. Then you need to stimulate nerve fibers to synapse on the regrown cell. you have to also worry about the supporting cells and the rest of the structures in the inner ear.\n\nDamage to the auditory nerve can be bypassed with [auditory brainstem implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_brainstem_implant) and [midbrain implants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762428).

So it doesn't really stretch the muscle, it reduces the tendency of the body to resist the stretch.\n\nExpansion: PNF stretching is a fairly advanced, intense stretching technique that uses isometric contractions while the muscle is in a near maximal stretched state. This contraction is held for anywhere from 3-20 seconds, although [one study suggests][1] that there isn't really any difference between shorter and longer intervals in the stretch.\n\nThe mechanism is not really understood, the main theories currently is that if affects the stretch reflex, reciprocal inhibition and autogenic inhibition.\n\nThe stretch reflex is due to a muscle spindle (nerve receptor), that when a muscle is stretched suddenly, it sends a signal to the brain to contract the muscle. The greater the stretch, the more forceful the contraction. If you increase the ROM of the muscle, you are less likely to fire the stretch reflex. (As an aside, when the doctor whacks your knee with the hammer to see it twitch, that's the stretch reflex in action).\n\nReciprocal inhibition - Agonist/antagonist muscles are muscles in opposition to each other such as biceps/triceps, hamstrings/quadriceps, etc. When an agonist muscle contracts, the spindle sends a message to the brain for the antagonist to relax. It is suggested that this mechanism is altered by PNF stretching.\n\nAutogenic inhibition - The golgi tendon organ fires when tension increases in the muscle, either due to contraction or to stretch, causing the agonist muscle to relax. This would override the tendency of the muscle to tighten under stress and relax, enabling a further ROM.\n\nFor additional reading, [here is an writeup][2] on PNF stretching discussing the various possible mechanisms of action, along with varying techniques of PNF (Contract/Relax, and Contract/Relax/Antagonist/Contract).

A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. However, only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one.\n>\n> A hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The hearing aid receives sound through a microphone, which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker.\n\nThings are a little messy because most people consider [ear trumpets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_trumpet) as an early for of hearing aid despite being completely passive.

Hearing aids amplify sounds so they may be detected by damaged ears. Cochlear implants bypass damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve. Signals generated by the implant are sent by way of the auditory nerve to the brain, which recognizes the signals as sound. Hearing through a cochlear implant is different from normal hearing and takes time to learn or relearn. However, it allows many people to recognize warning signals, understand other sounds in the environment, and understand speech in person or over the telephone.\n\n[Hearing aid indications](http://american-hearing.org/disorders/hearing-aids/#aids) are generally *mild or moderate bilateral hearing loss, who has experienced a noticeable communication handicap*. There is a push now to fit hearing aids to anyone, especially children with communication difficulties (e.g., this [AAA report](http://www.audiology.org/news/amplification-normal-hearing-children-apd)).\n\n[Cochlear implant indications](https://www.advancedbionics.com/content/dam/ab/Global/en_ce/documents/libraries/Professional%20Library/AB%20Product%20Literature/System_Indications_Precautions/Indications_and_Contraindications.pdf) are *postlingual onset of severe-to-profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with limited benefit from appropriately fitted hearing aids*.

Those in [Deaf Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture) tend to be against auditory assistive devices. Hearing aids are low risk and have a limited commitment.

Dietary salt intake has been linked to several diseases, more frequently cardiovascular diseases but also kidney stones and bone metabolism.\n\nAccording to its last guidance, the WHO recommends max 5 grams of salt per day (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/salt_potassium_20130131/en/) Nowadays it is quite simple to exceed these recommendations through the consumption of processed foods.

We call this practice \"evidence based medicine\" (EBM). What we call \"alternative medicine\" are all the alternative approaches where such standards are not or insufficiently implemented. The way medicine used to be practiced centuries ago is a good example of alternative medicine, we usually refer to this as [traditional medicine][1]:\n\n\n> Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine) comprises knowledge systems that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \"the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.\"[1]\n\nNow nutrition, while an integral part of the regular medical discipline (if you get diagnosed with diabetes, your endocrinologist may well refer you to a dietitian) fits in well within traditional medicine in the following sense. The knowledge we have about the food we eat has been passed on from generation to generation long before modern science came into existence. Basically, you've been told to eat your vegetables by your mother who was told the same by her mother etc. etc, you could probably trace this back to the time before modern humans even existed. When applying rigorous scientific standards to nutrition we then face a problem. How do we even define the problem when evaluating foods we eat? E.g. broccoli is not some drug designed to solve some specific medical problem, so you don't have a well defined end point that you can test.\n\nIt's of course, not a problem in principle to study some particular health effects of certain foods. In practice this can already be difficult, you can't perform double blind tests, so you need to resort to observational studies or controlled experiments that typically won't last very long. But the real problem is then the choice of the end point for health outcomes and the choice for what to compare the food item to. You can't e.g. simply look at all cause mortally. Suppose e.g. that [calorie restriction][2] would prevent prevent cancer and heart disease, if you stick to that diet you'll live a lot longer (assuming it would really work). But then it turns out that you'll have a lack of energy, you'll end up sleeping 12 hours a day. So, the end point of all cause mortality which looks to be a good criterion, could well lead to totally worthless result.\n\nBut to even get such results, you must make a decision to compare one type of diet to another diet. In older statistical studies dating back from the 1980s and earlier the mistake was made to just correlate intake of nutrients to health. As explained [in this article][3] this often leads to spurious results, as total energy intake is a huge confounding factor. Modern studies do the statistical analysis in such a way that total energy intake is taken into account. But there may be other confounding factors lurking which may not be as easily identified and dealt with.\n\nNow, the fact remains that if you today stick to what passes for a healthy diet, then you would be eating a diet that your great great great grandmother would probably also consider to be a healthy diet. So, even if we today know a bit more than your great great great grandmother (take e.g. vitamins), the information that describes what you would be eating  still largely derives from ancient knowledge. Modern science has had only a limited impact here. E.g. we now know that saturated fats may not be very healthy. On the other hand, a mistake was made when we wrongly thought we could produce healthier fats, trans fats were made as a healthier alternative to saturated fats, but this turned out to be much more damaging to our health.\n\n\nSo, at the end of the day, the patient who gets referred to a dietitian will end up being put on a diet that has its origins in what we could call traditional medicine. The healthy foods the patient would be eating like carrots cauliflowers, broccoli were created not as a result of moderns scientific efforts but they were cultivated more than 3000 years ago. \n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine\n  [2]: http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140401/ncomms4557/full/ncomms4557.html\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3521261", "5673": "Phones can interfere with pacemakers, but usually the [effects are rare][1] and can be avoided. \n\n> Dr. Carsten Lennerz, study lead author and cardiology resident in the\n> Clinic for Heart and Circulatory Diseases at Munich\u2019s German Heart\n> Centre, said that pacemakers in rare instances can mistakenly detect\n> electromagnetic interference from mobile phones.

Heating during the winter decreases humidity inside, while the cold air outside is always less humid.\n* [Vitamin D is thought to help against infection][4] - during the winter, vitamin D production by the body is lower. \n\nThings that are debated:\n\n* Crowding and being inside more might be a factor, with people being closer together because they spend a lot of time indoors.\n\nAs for the second question:\n\n> If nobody was sick before winter, where are the viruses coming from?\n\nWell, there's a whole different hemisphere \"down\" from where you probably are, where they have the flu season while the Northern Hemisphere is mostly healthy :) [Air travel is convenient for influenza.][5] Even without it, we'd still have influenza during the winter, though - as mentioned above it *does* occur in tropical areas and can spread from there.

In my attempt to answer it I'll cite sources from the best research on the subject to date, and we'll conduct our own investigation.\n\n## Body size vs. Head size vs. Brain volume\nIn your question, you asked how body size (weight and height) relates to brain volume by gender. Body size is related to brain volume through another measure, head size. Larger body, larger head, larger brain.<sup>[a](http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/321192)</sup> Men and women have different body sizes, and different head sizes as well.  \n\n****\n\n## Conducting our own investigation\n\n### Sample\n\nIn the paper you referenced, Gur et. al. looked at 80 healthy (40 male and 40 female) volunteers aged 18-45 years. They used an automated parcellation approach, meaning they used automated image processing on the brain images to derive their measurements.\n\nIn our investigation, we'll use data frome the publicly available [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/), or HCP. We'll look at 896 healthy (393 Male and 503 female) volunteers aged 22-36 years. HCP also used an automated parcellation software, called FreeSurfer.<sup>[b](http://www.sciencedirect.com.scopeesprx.elsevier.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912000389)</sup> We'll use IntraCranial Volume - the volume inside the cranium - to represent head size.\n\n### Total Brain Volume - Males vs Females\n\n[![tbv in male vs female][1]][1]\n[![tbv in male vs female linear model][2]][2]\n<p></p>\nWe see here that men have larger brains than women. We can also see from the linear model results that the estimated mean difference from our sample is a substantial 153.9 milliliters (as compared to ~200 milliliters in Gur et. al. 2001). For reference, this is about 2/3 one of those half pint boxes of milk you used to get at school lunch.\n\nBut how much is total brain volume related to head size?\n\n### TBV vs ICV\n\n[![tbv vs icv][3]][3]\n\nWe can see right away that these two measures are highly correlated. It makes sense. Typically, bigger animals -- with corresponding bigger heads -- have bigger brains:\n\n![animal brains](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Brain-body_mass_ratio_for_some_animals_diagram.svg/500px-Brain-body_mass_ratio_for_some_animals_diagram.svg.png)\n\nBut what you want to know is whether the difference remains *after accounting for head size*. In other words, is the difference disproportionate to head size?\n\n### Adjusting TBV by ICV\n\nHere we use a method called residualizing to remove the effect of ICV on TBV we observed above. You can find the code we're using [here](https://github.com/keshlab/returnAdj.R/blob/master/returnAdj.R), and a reference describing the procedure in detail [here][4].\n\nLet's check the graph of TBV vs ICV again, to make sure the effect is removed.\n\n[![adj tbv vs icv][5]][5]\n\n\n### Revisiting TBV in Males vs Females\n\nHere we'll reexamine the difference between Male and Female brain sizes using the adjusted values.\n[![adj tbv in male vs female][6]][6]\n[![adj tbv in male vs female linear model][7]][7]\n\nThe difference is still statistically significant, but smaller. The linear model estimates the adjusted average difference to be 23.6 milliliters (compared to 153.9 before). Going back to the milk reference, this is about 1/10 the box, or one sip.\n\n****\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe found that the difference in brain volumes between men and women is partially, but not completely explained by their difference in head sizes.\n\nThe difference is smaller, but still there after adjusting. **Now your next question may be, so what?** Do these differences in brain volume explain anything about behavior or ability? That's where papers like the one you referenced come in. \n\nGur et. al. suggest in their paper that females compensate for smaller total brain volume by having increased gray matter, and therefore more tissue available for computation. Other studies conclude that in order to understand gender differences in cognitive ability, you have to look closer at the parts of the brain that are activated during different tasks.<sup>[c](http://www.sciencedirect.com.scopeesprx.elsevier.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011)</sup>\n\nThe HCP data could help us test these ideas too, but that's outside the scope of your question.\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/a0iRI.png\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Cg4D.png\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohjHh.png\n  [4]: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-585-25657-3_18\n  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/htsUE.png\n  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4nJik.png\n  [7]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSNaa.png", "3727": "While I consider this hypothesis unlikely, but possible, there are things that could be done to investigate this idea directly (most likely at consuming a significant amount of personal funds if you are willing to find anyone to do them).\n\nFirst, yes bloating or excessive intestinal gas disorders/diseases exists.  While not a [great journal][1], and one that uses industry standards that differ from more established guidelines, [here is a review][2] that should be more approachable to the public.\n\nThe first and most obvious would be to look for excessive intestinal gasses.  This would be noted by increased [flatulence][3], or if in an extreme case, a local build-up would be noticeable in a CT or X-ray.  The fact that it is not moving around, but staying in your upper right abdomen, would mean that a local build up would be more likely, and thus more likely to be found in radiology.  The fact that these tests were done, but did not yield results is evidence against the idea.\n\nIf you really want to test the output [metabolome][4] of your [intestinal flora][5], you're probably better suited to test the [volatile organic compounds (VOCs)][6] found in your flatulence.  [A group][7] in the Netherlands, who own the design to a particular [electronic nose][8] called [eNose][9], published the idea of [using feacal volatiles to][10] \"considerably improve screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring for gastro-intestinal diseases.\"\n\nThis is certainly not an FDA approved method, and again it was published in the same low-impact journal that caters to companies publishing about their own tech.

The [innate immune system][1] is a very old part (which doesn't mean it's bad or superfluous, on the contrary) that is responsible for a nonspecific immune response when the body encounters a pathogen. This is a very quick response and includes inflammatory responses and fever. Since most bacteria grow better at a temperature of 37\u00b0C than at a slightly higher temperature, a fever is a normally beneficial response to any kind of pathogen and thus triggered often \n 2. The [adaptive immune system, also called the humoral or specific immune response][2]. Evolutionary speaking, this is newer. The main components are B-cells and T-cells and it is pretty complex, but the basics are that this is what reacts to antigens to produce antibodies to specific pathogens. After the first encounter, this makes sure that the next time the same pathogen is encountered, the immune response is quicker and shorter.  \n\n*The immune response to vaccinations*\n\nThe infant's immune system really is capable of handling a lot more antigens than it is exposed to in a vaccine + its live environment at any one point in time. I suggest you read the review by Paul Offit, who is cited in the article you linked to, for more information on that, [Addressing parents' concern: Do multiple vaccines overwhelm or weaken the infant's immune system][3]. Basically, the specific immune response mediated by B- and T-cells can handle a specific immune response for a large number of antigens at once. \n\nThis number is largely *independent* of what you are seeing in the child. The number of antigens the immune system can handle says nothing about what symptoms the immune response will cause, because the effects you can see is largely the innate immune response. Small children get a fever pretty often because most pathogens are new to them and the innate immune system responds to that with a fever. Exposure to several pathogens at once does not cause a higher fever. \n\nWith vaccines there is no actual risks of the child getting the disease. The vaccines contain [attenuated or dead viruses or no pathogens at all][4] (the [tetanus one][5], for example, is against the toxin, not the bacterium producing it). The adaptive immune system needs [days to weeks to produce the correct antibodies][6] in sufficient quantities, but it carries no risk of them suddenly developing measles or something like that. Unfortunately, we can't really tell the immune system we only need the antibodies, not the cytokines all the other parts that may let the child *appear* sick when it really isn't. So the innate immune response happens and may appear to weaken the child and leads to parents to jumping to the conclusion that this is too much for such a small child. Nobody is saying a fever is fun for the infant/baby of course, but in essence, vaccination is a risk/benefits calculation. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that several of the vaccinations given in childhood are combination vaccines (MMR, DTP,..), and the immune response is still not in any way overwhelmed. And these are several vaccines for diseases that are actually dangerous (diphtheria, pertussis,...) given together. The resources don't get used up because different cells are doing different things and, even more, the B-cells that respond to the measles vaccines are not used for the immune response towards the rhinovirus the child is exposed to at the same time. \n\nThe number of antigens is used for that reason - it's a metric to show that the humoral immune response is really capable of doing a lot of stuff at once. It's just that many people see the fever vaccinations can cause and then conclude that a child is actually sick after a vaccination and therefore their immune system must be \"weakened\" (which, outside of actually immunocompromised people is another ill-defined concept) by the vaccine and incapable of dealing with other things at the same time. It isn't. That fever is the body unspecifically reacting to anything that warrants an immune reaction, because the specific and unspecific parts of it didn't evolve to be independent. \n\nAlso, nobody is saying anything about \"straining\" the immune system,  because \"straining the immune system\" does not have a defined meaning. What they are saying is that a child's immune system is more than equipped to deal with several things at once. \n\n*Delaying vaccinations*\n\nThat delaying vaccinations for fear of overwhelming the immune system is unnecessary can be seen by what happens in  children who are already sick and receive a vaccine. The answer is \"not much out of the ordinary\". The innate immune response is launched already and the adaptive immune response can deal with everything at once. \n\n> vaccine-specific antibody responses and rates of vaccine-associated adverse reactions of children with mild or moderate illnesses are comparable to those of healthy children. For example, the presence of upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, fever, skin infections, or diarrhea do not affect the level of protective antibodies induced by immunization\n\nThe recommendation to delay vaccines when the child has a serious illness is not based on the child's immune system not being able to \"handle\" both, but on trying not to \"mix\" symptoms and avoiding adverse vaccination reactions on top of an illness. \n\n> Vaccination should be deferred for persons with a moderate or severe acute illness. This precaution avoids causing diagnostic confusion between manifestations of the underlying illness and possible adverse effects of vaccination or superimposing adverse effects of the vaccine on the underlying illness. \n\n[General recommendations on Immunization by the CDC][7] - also a very good read. \n\nThe actual study behind that WSJ article is [On-time vaccine receipt in the first year does not adversely affect neuropsychological outcomes][8], though that deals only with neurological outcomes and not infections. \n\n> Timely vaccination during infancy has no adverse effect on neuropsychological outcomes 7 to 10 years later.\n\nAs a general note on delayed schedules, there has been no evidence presented so far that delaying vaccines has any benefits whatsoever, for example less or less severe infections during childhood. Of course the vaccine schedule is not evidence-based down to the weeks where everything is given - of course parts of it could be delayed by two weeks, other parts could be given two weeks earlier, etc. Nobody is going to design 200 different schedules, enroll thousands of children in a study and test all possible schedules. \n\nBut what we have is definitely not overwhelming the immune system and for most children, it ensures that by the time the body encounters the actually infectious pathogens in the wild, the specific immune response to it is already in place and parents will never even notice their child was exposed. \n\n*Additional sources and further reading*\n\n[CDC - Principles of Vaccination][9]\n\n[WHO - Vaccine immunology][10]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26846/\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10752/\n  [3]: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/109/1/124\n  [4]: http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/different-types-vaccines\n  [5]: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/tetanus/\n  [6]: http://www.immunologyexplained.co.uk/HowItWorks.aspx\n  [7]: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6002a1.htm\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20498176\n  [9]: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/prinvac.pdf\n  [10]: http://www.who.int/immunization/.../Elsevier_Vaccine_immunology.pdf", "4158": "I wasn't able to find a study that looked at both meditation and exercise - besides ones about yoga - but I was able to find many that looked at each separately and seemed to indicate that combining the two is simple and effective.\n\n**Exercise**\n\n - One of the best sources was a thesis by Nikelle Holbrook Hunsaker entitled [**\"The Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy\"**](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/honors/105/) (pdf [here](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&context=honors)).

This conclusion agrees with the results of **Liu et al. (2008)**.\n  - A similar exercise program can reduce the risk of type II diabetes, according to **Kim et al. (2010)**.

They found no difference in the effect of exercise on the children, but did notice that the mothers experienced reduced pain and discomfort.\n - [**May et al.

Things to consider:\n\n- type of condom\n- correct usage of condom\n- point in the menstrual cycle\n\n**Condom type**\n\nLatex condoms are somewhat more effective than polyurethane condoms, mostly due to breakage and slippage. However, since in your scenario the condom doesn't break (and we assume it didn't slip), breakage or slippage would not be a problem in the calculations. For this scenario, we'll use the effectiveness of a latex condom.\n\n**Correct usage**\n\nMale condoms remain a highly effective contraceptive method when used correctly. Latex condoms are 98% effective, meaning that two out of 100 women correctly using male condoms as a means of contraception will become pregnant **in one year**. Use of out-of-date condoms, spermicidal jelly or the wrong kind of lubricant with latex condoms, etc. decreases the efficacy of condoms. In this scenario, we'll assume a not-expired condom, applied properly (not applied and taken off and reapplied, or used more than once, etc.) (Please note, however, it only takes one \"successful\" mating to become pregnant.)\n\n**The menstrual cycle**\n\nA menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and ends the day before the next period begins. Most women will experience some variation in the length of cycles throughout their lives; normally, though, a cycle is between 21 and 35 days. \n\nOvulation usually occurs about 14 days before the next cycle begins, but it can vary. If you have a short cycle (say, 24 days) and your bleeding lasts 5 days, this means you likely ovulate around day 10; add one day for every day that your cycle is longer (so in a 35 day cycle, you will likely ovulate on day 21.) Pregnancies occur within a 6 day fertile window. This \u201cfertile window\u201d is comprised of the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. Sex must occur on one of these days (and, yes, it can be only once. It makes no difference if it's the first time or the 50th.) This is because sperm can live for up to five days, traveling to meet the ovulated egg. \n\n>Overall, an estimated 2% of women were in their fertile window by the fourth day of their cycle and 17% by the seventh day (based on 213 women). This percentage peaked on days 12 and 13, when 54% of women were in their fertile window. If ovulation was delayed, women reached their fertile days much later. Among women who reached the fifth week of their cycle, 4-6% were in their fertile window.\n\nThis graph shows the probability of women being in their fertile window on a specific day in their cycle.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nIf a woman has a 28 day cycle (the most common), and stops bleeding on day five, on day 6, there is a less than 20% chance that of her being in her fertile window.\n\n**What it boils down to**\n\nEven with ejaculation, a latex condom used correctly is between 98% and 99% effective (odds of pregnancy: .02); if the woman has a 28 day cycle, the odds of being in her window of fertility on day 6 is ~15% (.15). Doing the math, .15 x .02 = .0003, which means she has **at most** a 3 in 10,000 chance of becoming pregnant from this interaction. Because of the lack of ejaculation, the chance is reduced by a factor of 10 (to account for sperm in the pre-ejaculate), so the chance is approximately 3 in 100,000. \n\nThat is a very small chance of being pregnant. As a way to put that into perspective, that is only (roughly) 15 times more likely than a person's chance of being killed by an asteroid. \n\nThough the chance is very small, it is not zero. For this reason, one can take a urine test to reassure oneself as soon as the 28th day.\n\n<sub>Read the information in the references below to learn how to keep yourself safe while having sex.</sub>\n\n\n\n<sub>[Nonlatex vs. latex male condoms for contraception: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Nonlatex+vs.+latex+male+condoms+for+contraception%3A+a+systematic+review+of+randomized+controlled+trials.)</sub>  \n<sub>[Condoms](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/male-condoms.aspx)</sub>  \n<sub>[The timing of the \u201cfertile window\u201d in the menstrual cycle: day specific estimates from a prospective study](http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7271/1259.short)</sub>  \n\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BwiRy.gif", "1478": "The [manufacturer\u2019s prescribing information][pi] (a.k.a. package insert) provides recommended dosing based on safety and efficacy data obtained during the drug development and approval process.

Your question is about the second group.\n\n\u201cInstantly\u201d (as noted in the comments) is a little absurd; there is obviously some delay between the time of ingestion of the medication and its effect at receptors that provides relief of pain. However, you\u2019re right to note that the time-to-onset of anti-migraine effect is relevant, and this is a case where the available medications do vary in this respect in a way that tempers their usefulness. \n\n**Relevant pharmacology: routes of administration**  \n\nMedications taken **orally** (by mouth) are generally the slowest to onset of action. Intravenous medications, introduced directly into the bloodstream, are generally the fastest. Perhaps less well-known are other methods that are nearly as fast as IV: **sublingual**, **intranasal**, and **inhaled**. In each of these cases, the medication is placed in apposition to blood vessels that are able to absorb it directly. This only works for certain types of medications (mostly *lipophilic* ones that can cross into blood vessels), but it\u2019s fast and avoids some of the difficulties of oral administration.<sup>*</sup>  **Subcutaneous**, **transdermal** or **intramuscular** administration is generally also somewhat quicker to reach the bloodstream than oral medications.\n\n**Migraines: oral may not be best**  \n\nFor reasons that are not fully understood, abortive medications are more effective when used early in the attack, so the quicker routes of administration are also expected to provide relatively more benefit. In addition, migraine headaches are often associated with severe nausea and vomiting which may limit the utility of oral medications. Even when vomiting is not present, migraines are associated with gastric stasis, meaning that the stomach is slow to empty into the duodenum, the part of the gut where medications are generally absorbed.\n\nAbortive medications for migraines:  \n\n- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs)**: particularly for mild attacks, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs are all effective. The only NSAID available for non-oral use (at least in the US) is ketorolac, which is effective with IV or IM administration (ASA and ketorolac references given below; others available upon request.)\n- **Triptans**: This class of drugs is the mainstay of abortive treatment for moderate to severe migraines. Triptans are available for a variety of routes of administration. Sumatriptan can be given as a subcutaneous injection (usually via auto-injector in the thigh), as a nasal spray, or orally; a transdermal preparation is planned to be marketed in 2015. Zolmitriptan is available for both nasal and oral use. Non-oral routes of administration tend to be fastest.

They found that the prohormone *prepro-orexin* was found in a very small area of the hypothalamus which had been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis; this suggested the possibility that the neuropeptides might be involved in the regulation of food intake. When administered into free-feeding rats' brains, one of these peptides (orexin A/hypocretin 1) stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent manner (with attention to light and dark periods, i.e. the circadian rhythm), with a lower dose increasing rat feeding about 2-fold, and the higher dose inducing a 3+-fold increase in feeding compared to rats injected with a solution without the peptide (the other stimulated feeding to a lesser degree). The effect persisted for 4 hours. Furthermore, fasting rats produced more than twice as much orexins as rats feeding freely. For this reason, the molecules were names \"orexins\", after the Greek word *orexis*, which means \"appetite\". They speculated that the orexin-secreting neurons might somehow be modulated by glucose.\n\nAt the same time, another group of researchers using a completely different approach found that the same group of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated by a peptide hormone similar in composition to the gut hormone *secretin*. They identified the same prohormone and its two peptides, naming them *hypocretins* for \"hypothalamus\" and \"secretin\". They found that at least one of the peptides had a neuroexcitatory activity in specific areas of the brain (they mapped effects in the hypothalamic neurons, the posterior hypothalamus, the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the colliculi, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract) suggesting that the peptides acted within the central nervous system as homeostatic regulators with a role in nutritional homeostasis.\n\nScientists have not decided on whether to call them *orexins* or *hypocretins* yet, so both are used. They are found in all vertebrates.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n<sub>Mammalian orexin A sequences thus far identified (human, rat, mouse, pig, dog, sheep, and cow) are all identical, whereas the sequences of orexin B show some differences among species. From *Orexin/Hypocretin: A Neuropeptide at the Interface of Sleep, Energy Homeostasis, and Reward System*, Natsuko Tsujino and Takeshi Sakurai </sub>\n\nIn 1999, a group of scientists found that narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness) was caused by a lack of a hypocretin/orexin receptor 2 gene in certain dogs, therefore establishing that they play a very important part in the regulation of wakefulness.*\n\nSince then, an enormous body of work has shown that orexins/hypocretins (O/H from here on in) are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviors, including wakefulness and vigilance (needed to find food), systems that regulate emotion and reward (including drug-seeking behavior when stressed and eating for pleasure - \"consumption beyond homeostatic needs\" - leading to obesity), and more.**\n\n**What does eating have to do with sleepiness?**\n\nSeveral studies report that the firing rates of O/H neurons are influenced by serum glucose, triglycerides and amino acids. \n\nIn English, and in your case: You are awake (O/H is being secreted by O/H neurons in your hypothalamus). You eat. Your serum glucose rises. The elevated glucose causes depolarization of inhibitory neurons *that hyperpolarize O/H neurons decreasing the amount of O/H. released.* Result: wakefulness decreases. (You can barely make it to your bed, in your case!)\n\n**What about Thanksgiving in a pill?**\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration recently approved suvorexant (Belsomra) for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The (prescription only) drug is an *orexin receptor antagonist* and is the first approved drug of this type. It blocks the effect of orexin in wakefulness (isn't science grand?) Unlike benzodiazepines and other hypnotics, rather than promoting sleep, suvorexant inactivates wakefulness, and rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed when suvorexant was discontinued after 3 months or 12 months of *nightly* use. It does have risks and side effects, but so far its safety profile looks pretty good.\n\n<sub>Comparing these two papers - the first and second references - is a wonderful example of the completely different methods used by scientists to investigate unknowns and up with the same basic conclusion.</sub>  \n<sub>[Orexins and orexin receptors: a family of hypothalamic neuropeptides and G protein-coupled receptors that regulate feeding behavior](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400809496), Cell 92 (4): 573\u201385</sub>    \n<sub>[The hypocretins: Hypothalamus-specific peptides with neuroexcitatory activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18213/) Proc.

Acrylamide levels appear to rise as food is heated for longer periods of time.\n\nUnlike frying and baking, based on FDA studies<sup>[2008][12]</sup>, microwaving whole potatoes with skin on to make \u201cmicrowaved baked potatoes\u201d does not produce acrylamide, although unlike deep-frying, it has limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels<sup>[1999][13]</sup>.\n\nHowever acrylamide can been found in other microwaved products such as popcorn.\n\n### Foodborne illness\n\nMicrowave ovens are frequently used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination may not be repressed if the safe temperature is not reached, resulting in [foodborne illness][14].\n\n### Radiation\n\nThe radiation produced by a microwave oven is non-ionizing (in comparison to X-rays and high-energy particles which are associated with the cancer risks).\n\nLong-term studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity microwave radiation (2.45GHz) even with chronic exposure levels<sup>[1998][15], [1998][16]</sup>.\n\nHowever, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating, although the modern design of microwave ovens is equipped with safety switches that turn off the radiation when the door is open and ovens are sufficiently insulated to allow only \"minimal leakage\" when the oven is working.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAny form of cooking will destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food, but it depends how much water is used in the cooking, how long the food is cooked and at what temperature<sup>[2006][17]</sup>.\n\nHowever comparative cooking method studies generally find that, if properly used, microwave cooking does not affect the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating<sup>[1995][18]</sup>.\n\nSee also:\n\n - [Microwave: Effects on food and nutrients][19] at Wikipedia\n - [Microwave cooking and food safety][20] at CFS\n\n\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10554220\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17979232\n  [4]: http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art52758.asp\n  [5]: http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art52758.asp\n  [6]: http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art52758.asp\n  [7]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643808000509\n  [8]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html\n  [9]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12166997\n  [12]: http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/ChemicalContaminants/ucm151000.htm\n  [13]: http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/picoline_508.pdf\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9806599\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9453703\n  [17]: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html\n  [18]: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00346659510088654\n  [19]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven#Effects_on_food_and_nutrients\n  [20]: http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/files/microwave_ra_e.pdf", "603": "[Another answer][aa] did a great job laying out some of the difficulties plaguing research on this topic. Observational data in the area are (hopelessly?) confounded. I would like to point out two alternative lines of research that may leave the reader with some hope that we\u2019ll eventually have a good answer to this question.\n\n1. **Surrogate markers**: A major difficulty with research in this area is that it\u2019s not practical to randomize an adequate number of people to alcohol vs no alcohol<sup>1</sup> for a long enough period of time to see statistically significant differences in outcomes like heart attacks, strokes, and death. However, in many areas &mdash; most prominently cardiovascular disease &mdash; researchers have used [surrogate markers][jc] that tend to evolve more quickly and have been shown to correlate with the *real* endpoint that we are interested in. This approach allows us to:\n  -  Acquire **randomized** data due to the shorter duration of study required, avoiding all of the mess of observational confounds or; \n -  (Less optimal but still something): use observational methods but analyze endpoints that are less likely to be confounded. \n\n    I include two papers that review interventional data suggesting a benefit of alcohol on surrogate endpoints: \n\n   [Effect of alcohol consumption on biological markers associated with risk of coronary heart disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies.][sb]<sup>2</sup>\n\n   [The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Insulin Sensitivity and Glycemic Status: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Intervention Studies.][is]<sup>3</sup> \n\n   Despite the feasibility benefits of surrogate endpoints, these [\u201cmarkers of malign\u201d carry certain caveats][jc] and can not be regarded as providing a definitive answer about whether alcohol should be recommended to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\n\n2. **Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials** (with real endpoints) **in the making**: \nThis is what we want. There is an [NIH U34] active for planning a multi-center [long-term randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of alcohol on the development of chronic diseases.][km] You may be wondering how you randomize and blind people to alcohol consumption. Although the methodology of that large trial is not yet published (to my knowledge), the Mukamal lab has a history of [putting tasteless grain alcohol in Crystal Light][ctg] (see also, [WallStreet Journal blog piece][wsj]). That feasibility study was completed; I look forward to updating this answer in a few years when the data from the large RCT are published.\n\n------\n<sub>\n1. Note that although resveratrol, a component of red wine, has been publicized as the possibly beneficial agent (partly because it can be put in supplements and sold...), many researchers in the field consider ethanol itself to be of more interest. The data in this answer all investigate ethanol rather than other components of wine or beer, several of which may carry additional benefits.\n</sub>  \n\n<sub>\n2. Brien, SE et al.

Individual studies show differing levels of some minerals, and differences are dependent upon the particular fruit, leafy vegetable, or root crop. ([2]).\n - Organic crops have more antioxidants ([2], [5]), like (poly)phenolics and flavonoids ([3]).\n - Organic crops have more vitamins, like vitamin C ([1], [2], [5]), and carotenoids ([3])\n - Organic crops have better proteins, content of amino acids is more balanced ([1])  \n\nToxic and potentially dangerous compounds\n-----------------------------------------\n\n - Organic crops have less pesticide residues ([3], [6])\n - Organic crops have less nitrates ([1], [2])\n - Organic crops have less heavy metals, like cadmium ([1], [3]), lead ([1]), mercury ([1]) and aluminium ([1]).\n\nOther findings\n--------------\n\n - Organic crops have less proteins ([1], [2]) and vitamin E ([3])\n - There are no significant differences about contents of As and Pb ([3])\n - Lester and Saftner ([2]) in their review address the aspect of **taste evaluation**: \"*Few organically versus conventionally grown produce comparison studies include consumer or trained sensory tests. Consumer sensory tests generally consist of nontrained panelists with no prior knowledge of the objectives of the sensory test*\" and conclude that more scientific studies with more standardized evaluation methods are required to conclusively assess about the issue.\n\nDiscrepancies\n-------------\n\nSome studies have concluded that there's \"*no evidence of a difference in nutrient quality between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs*\" ([4]). Probably this is due to the smaller base of evidence, as stated by Baranski et al. 2014 ([3]) that relies on 343 publications.\n\nDangour et al. 2009, that relies on 55 studies, agrees on higher phosphorus content of organic crops, but doesn't detect any difference in the other nutrient categories. ([4])\n\nLester-Saftner 2011 doesn't explicitly mention the number of articles it relies on; the \"references\" section is made of 66 articles. It shares most of the findings with other studies, except for heavy metals and B-complex vitamins. ([2])\n\nSmith-Spangler 2012, based on 223 studies, identifies some evidence for the superiority of organic foods, but considers it limited, not robust enough. ([6])\n\nNotes about GMOs and environmental sustainability\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe field of study is very wide, consensus is not reached and a correct answer would require a separate thread only dedicated to this topic. As you ask in your question about this topic, I shortly list some notes catched from a good study ([7]) that can be used to get a **quick idea** about the issue:\n\n - GMOs increase the risk of exposure to herbicide residues, that are found to be toxic, and their toxicity may increase based on interaction among individual compounds;\n - GMOs might cause allergic reactions;\n - GMOs might be poorer of micronutrients due to increased yields and diluition effect;\n - GMOs are related to deforestation and desertification, but this is more related to development policies and economics than biology;\n - some GMOs might be related to death of nontarget insects, like bees that are essential to plant reproduction;\n - GMOs affect food sovereignty and small scale producers survival due to intellectual property rights issues.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n - ([1]) Worthington, V.

Spicy foods help to raise your metabolic rate, which will slow down your weight gain. If you eat spicy foods often, the effects add up.<sup>1</sup>\n\nA 2007 study by Nottingham University<sup>2</sup> found that spicy foods can help kill cancer cells. Capsaicin, which is what makes many foods spicy, attacks the mitochondria of the cancer cells, triggering their death. \n\nSpicy foods have also been found to help decongest your sinuses.

But inactivation was more rapid at warmer temperature, 20 deg C.  At 40 degrees, both viurses were inactivated more rapidly.  Humidity was different, as there was greater survival at high (80%).\n    The Abstract: Assessment of the risks posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on surfaces requires data on survival of this virus on environmental surfaces and on how survival is affected by environmental variables, such as air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH). The use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces. Two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were used to determine effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel. At 4 degrees C, infectious virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH. Inactivation was more rapid at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the slowest inactivation occurred at low RH. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The relationship between inactivation and RH was not monotonic, and there was greater survival or a greater protective effect at low RH (20%) and high RH (80%) than at moderate RH (50%).

If someone uses them, they are probably 10 or more years behind the times.  The current one is tendinopathy.  Tendinopathies provoke little or no inflammation, and we still have a long way to understand them.  In particular, every person's tendons suffer disrepair and tears during their lifetime, but only a few feel pain --which can be present with little or no damage.  \n\n\n\n\nSteven Low (Overcoming Gravity, Bad Posture, and soon, Tendonitis)\n\nhttp://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/\n \n* Connective tissue has less blood supplies than muscles, so it can't keep up if there's overuse.\n* Tendinopathies provoke little or no inflammation.  There's not really such a thing as tendinitis.\n* An overloaded tendon goes into reactive tendinopathy: pain and microscopic degenerative damage that can be fully healed.\n* If stress continues, normal regeneration processes can't keep up and tendon disrepair occurs, where collagen fibres are deposited out of alignment, leading to reactive on degenerative tendinopathy.  An MRI can show small damage.\n* Further damage produces a degenerative tendinopathy: the tendon fibers regenerate hap which can't be reversed.  Again, no inflammation, but large scale disruptions on tendon tissue, and the possibility of tearing under heavy loads.\n\n  Jill Cook et all:\n\n[Current trends in tendinopathy management][1]\n\n> Tendinopathy (pain and dysfunction in a tendon) is a prevalent\n> clinical musculoskeletal presentation across the age spectrum, mostly\n> in active and sporting people. Excess load above the tendon's usual\n> capacity is the primary cause of clinical presentation.

I've condensed the relevant bits of the following paper:\n\n> [**Jenkins & Mulhall. Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia. *Fertility and Sterility,* 2015; 104(5):1082-1088.**](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)01957-3/fulltext)\n\n>> Delayed orgasm/anorgasmia defined as the persistent or recurrent difficulty, delay in, or absence of attaining orgasm after sufficient sexual stimulation, which causes personal distress. Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia are associated with significant sexual dissatisfaction. A focused medical history can shed light on the potential etiologies, which include medications, penile sensation loss, endocrinopathies, penile hyperstimulation, and psychological etiologies. Unfortunately, there are no excellent pharmacotherapies for delayed orgasm/anorgasmia, and treatment revolves largely around addressing potential causative factors and psychotherapy.\n\n> **Definition**\n\n>> Delayed orgasm is further classified as lifelong/acquired, generalized/situational, and mild/moderate/severe. An acquired dysfunction establishes that the patient previously had normal orgasm timing. Situational dysfunction implies the man has problems in a particular scenario or scenarios, yet functioning normally in others.\n\n>> There is no set time threshold for what defines DO. Time threshold for distress is dependent on the partners involved. Some men will reach orgasm with one partner in 15 minutes and have no distress, but with another partner it may cause severe distress because the partner may complain of pain with prolonged intercourse. A population-based survey established that the median intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) was 5.4 minutes and 2 SD above was approximately 22 minutes. A provider with a patient complaining of IELT longer than 22 minutes will theoretically qualify him for the diagnosis of DO. One should differentiate between problems with of ejaculation and orgasm.\n\n> **Physiology of orgasm**\n\n>> Orgasm is a complex neurobiological process that comes as a result of sexual activity (physical sensation) and/or arousal (cognitive awareness). The physiology of ejaculation is discussed elsewhere. When ejaculation occurs, the brain processes the sensation of the pressure buildup within the posterior urethra (bladder neck and external urinary sphincter are closed contemporaneously) leading up to seminal fluid emission and the contraction of the periurethral musculature. This processing leads to the triggering of an orgasm.\n\n> **Pathophysiology**\n\n>> **Hyperstimulation** \n\n>>> Some men obtain greater pleasure from masturbation than they do with sexual intercourse and may continue deep-rooted habits such as frequent masturbation or using idiosyncratic masturbation techniques. Studies have shown a correlation between DO and men with idiosyncratic masturbation practices. Also, with increasing frequency of masturbation the sensitivity of the penis can decline and lead to a vicious cycle where the man increases masturbation force to counteract the declining sensitivity, therefore leading to worsening DO. Vaginal intercourse or orogenital stimulation may not be able to replicate the stimulation achieved through idiosyncratic masturbation and this may result in reduced penile stimulation leading to difficulty achieving an orgasm.\n\n>> **Penile Sensation Loss**\n\n>>> Penile sensation loss has been shown to increase with age. In a literature review by Rowland, he plotted penile sensory thresholds as a function of age as well as sexual functional status. He found that penile sensation loss was more commonly present in those men with increased age and those with sexual dysfunctions.\n\n>> **Psychosexual Causes**\n\n>>> Delayed orgasm based on situational aspects (i.e., difficulties with a specific partner and not with another) is more likely to be due to a psychological etiology. One study looked at stress and anxiety related to timed intercourse demands for fertility treatments and found DO developed in 6% of patients related to elevated anxiety levels. A novel study by Kirby et al. used a rat model to show how stress can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is important in healthy normal sexual function. They showed that acute and chronic immobilization stress led to an increase in adrenal glucocorticoids causing an increase in gonadotropin inhibitory hormone, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by inhibition of GnRH.\n\n> **Management strategies**\n\n>> It is true that some men with DO/AO never have an etiology diagnosed that reflects our limited understanding of the physiology of orgasm and the pathophysiology of these conditions. Therapy is focused on defining and treating any overt underlying causes often in conjunction with psychotherapy. Various lifestyle changes include steps to improve intimacy, reduce masturbation frequency, change of masturbation style, and decreasing alcohol consumption.\n\n>> [![DO figure][1]][1]\n\n---\n\nOther possibilities, if I'm misinterpreting your question:\n\n[Hypersexual disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersexual_disorder) (HD; \"a pattern of behavior involving intense preoccupation with sexual fantasies, urges and activities, leading to adverse consequences and clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important functions\") was considered for inclusion in the DSM-5, but was eventually rejected by the American Psychiatric Association:\n\n> [**Reid & Kafka. Controversies About Hypersexual Disorder and the DSM-5. *Current Sexual Health Reports,* 2014; 6(4):259-264.**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11930-014-0031-9)\n\n>> The concept of mental disorders has also been condemned by some who suggest it is a value-laden socially constructed phenomena used to impose conformity to cultural norms. Not surprisingly, similar arguments have been launched against the HD proposal with allegations that HD pathologizes normal variants of healthy sexual behavior, and hence, it does not meet the requirements for \u201cdeviance.\u201d Another frequent criticism is that HD could be an extension or manifestation of an existing mental disorder. This latter critique should not be quickly dismissed given high comorbidity rates of other mental illness commonly reported among treatment-seeking samples of hypersexual patients. Further, it is widely believed among clinicians working with hypersexual patients that sex is used to \u201ccope\u201d with challenging situations or as a way of \u201ccoping\u201d in the wake of emotional distress. Such assertions might imply that hypersexuality is an attempt to compensate for maladaptive systems designed to regulate emotion. Subsequently, wouldn\u2019t the more parsimonious conceptualization of hypersexuality be some type of an emotional dysfunction disorder or an adjustment disorder rather than an independent pathology? \n\n>> If one argues for HD as an independent disorder, they must also identify which internal functions are failing to operate and advance some theory implicating what mechanisms of action are purported to cause the dysfunction. Sadly, sex researchers investigating hypersexuality have often failed in this endeavor with a few notable exceptions. For example, neurobiological mechanisms linked to sexual excitation and sexual inhibition has been advanced as a plausible explanation for hypersexuality. A broader hypothesis about executive deficits in frontal lobe functioning reported mixed findings where hypersexual patients self-reported executive deficits but did not exhibit executive dysfunctions when tested. Many have suggested addiction, impulsivity, and compulsivity models, although it\u2019s questionable whether these conceptualizations really constitute theoretical models given their lack of specificity, falsifiable testability, or explanatory power for the construct of hypersexuality. Moreover, proponents of these approaches have yet to clearly operationalize and delineate the respective distinct contributions of addiction, impulsivity, or compulsivity as they relate to hypersexual behavior.\n\nWhile HD wasn't accepted as an established diagnosis, compulsive sexual behavior is a common disorder with similar criteria:\n\n> [**Derbyshire & Grant. Compulsive Sexual Behavior: A Review of the Literature. *Journal of Behavioral Addictions,* 2015; 4(2):37-43.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500883/)\n\n>> Compulsive sexual behavior can generally be divided into two categories: Paraphilic and nonparaphilic. Paraphilias are typically considered to be behaviors that have been deemed socially unacceptable that involve non-human objects, suffering of one\u2019s self or a partner, children or a non-consenting person (for example, fetishism, exhibitionism, and pedophilia). Nonparaphilic CSB, which is characterized by more typical sexual desires, include compulsive sexual acts with multiple partners, constant fixation on a partner that may be considered unobtainable, compulsive masturbation, compulsive use of pornography, and compulsive sex and sexual acts within a consensual relationship.\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLlfD.jpg", "19163": "If PCOS is unable to be diagnosed by the presence of the 2 other criteria out of the 3 you listed, then imaging is critical to diagnosis if PCOS is strongly suspected.  Diagnosis is important, as treatment can sometimes prevent complications.\n\nOf all imaging modalities, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first choice because it gives the best visualization of pelvic organs, as it can get closer to them than transabdominal ultrasound, and the ultrasound technology allows characterization of cysts based on echogenicity.\n\n[![transvaginal ultrasonography][1]][1]\n\nTransvaginal ultrasound is done using a probe that is covered with a condom-like sheath, and covered in lubrication.  The probe looks like this:\n\n[![TVUS probe][2]][2]\n\nThe probe is usually approximately the width of 2 fingers. If a woman is able to tolerate manipulation of tampons, it is less likely to cause trauma to the hymen.  Although there is some discomfort with the exam, most women report it is not as traumatic as it seemed it would be. \n\nHowever, there do exist [alternative recommendations][3] for diagnostic imaging in adolescents prior to sexual debut, which can be applied to virgin adults as well: \n\n> transabdominal ultrasound is preferred to the transvaginal approach in adolescent girls, but this approach may be technically limited in overweight and obese individuals.\u00a0\n\n\"Technically limited\" means that abdominal fat reduces the ability of ultrasound from outside the abdomen to visualize the ovaries accurately, and therefore may yield inconclusive results.  In that case, a transvaginal ultrasound would be preferred.  It is possible to start with a transabdominal ultrasound and then get transvaginal if the first is inconclusive.  Alternatively, CT scan or MRI are options; however, CT radiation is generally preferred to be avoided unless necessary (it exposes your ovaries to 200+ times the radiation of 1 chest Xray), and MRI is a long and expensive test.\n\nAn adolescent or adult with concerns about TVUS should talk with their provider to discuss the viability of alternative imaging options, if imaging is essential to the diagnosis, and perhaps look at an ultrasound probe to reduce concern with the use of the instrument.\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7aQx.png\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ikEbL.jpg\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3218544/", "19159": "[Drugs.com][1] mentions that prolonged use of Lugol's solution (potassium iodide + iodine) can cause *confusion,* caused by potassium.\n\nIn long-term treatment of Grave's disease (overactive thyroid), 10\u2013400\u2009mg iodide per day has been used ([PubMed, 2107][2]).\n\nVarious drug websites do not mention psychosis, aggressiveness, illusions or irritability as a side effect of potassium iodide.\n\nGrave's disease symptoms include irritability and anxiety, among others ([Mayo Clinic][3]).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.drugs.com/mmx/lugol-s-solution.html\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5693970/\n  [3]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240", "17877": "**Essential nutrient** means any substance normally consumed as a constituent of food which is *needed for growth and development and/or the maintenance of life* and which cannot be synthesized in adequate amounts by the body ([fao.org][1]).\n\n**Dietary fiber** does not meet the criteria of being needed for life/growth, so, strictly speaking, it is not an essential nutrient.

As per *[Crawford et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262107115_Changes_in_referral_rates_for_acute_toothpaste_ingestions_reported_to_the_NPIS)* the lowest dosage of fluoride seen producing symptoms was 1.6 mg/kg (the mean amount in asymptomatic patients was much higher at 3.89 mg/kg) - the classic \"pea-sized\" lump of toothpaste is [~ 0.25g](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283281) so taking me as an example..\n\nI weigh 59kg, meaning that using the lower 1.6mg/kg figure I'd have to be ingesting 0.0944g of fluoride before symptoms were even a possibility - looking at a relatively typical [fluoridated toothpaste](https://www.colgate.com/en-gb/products/toothpaste/ct-daily-repair) it has 1450ppm of Sodium Fluoride which means our initial 0.25g of toothpaste contains about 0.0003625g of sodium fluoride. Which is 0.145% of that initial 0.25g! So even if *all* of the initial 0.25g were ingested it doesn't even come close to the levels needed to cause symptoms\n\nSo it's not sounding as though that small an amount stands much chance of causing a problem. If we look at the other end of the scale the mean dosage of those who *were* symptomatic is 4.78 mg/kg so at my weight that would mean ingesting 0.28202g of sodium fluoride, which at 1450 mg/kg would mean eating a frankly insane amount of toothpaste! So I won't lose any sleep over the negligible amounts I may ingest from not rinsing, if I do rinse however I'm going to be removing the opportunity for the fluoride to do it's work on the teeth and removing a known benefit for avoiding an essentially negligible risk isn't a sensible trade-off. \n\nSo coming back to your three questions:\n\n>Even after spitting, wouldn't some toothpaste linger in the mouth?\n\nYes, that's the point.\n\n>After brushing, it's obviously impractical to keep returning to a sink to spit every time you have saliva. So wouldn't you swallow the residual toothpaste?\n\nA tiny bit yes.\n\n>If 2 is true, isn't swallowing any amount of toothpaste unhealthy?\n\nNope. The dose makes the poison and the dose is insufficient to cause health problems.\n\n\n\n", "17866": "Well, you can do do various surgical procedures on nerves. You can suture a macroscopic nerve (i.e. a nerve that you can see) that has been injured. However, there are various problems that come with suturing an injured nerve. \n\nOne of the main problems is that nerves are pretty unique histologically. Nerves comprise of the longest cells in the body with many of them spanning the distance from the spinal cord out to the fingers or toes. Although these cells are long they are extremely thin. These thin and long cells come together to form a nerve. Each cell is connected to their respective muscle fibers and control their contraction. \n\nWhen a nerve is injured or ruptured these cells break, and these connections break too. You don't have a lot of time to connect them back together and if you do it is impossible to connect the nerves absolutely correctly together. So although some function of the nerve might be retained it might, at least at first, be severely impaired. This might be somewhat improved with rehabilitation.\n\nFor an analogy you could imagine a doorbell with the wires joined into one big cable and then branching out to a bunch of different apartments. If you cut on the big common cable and join it randomly together most of the doorbells might work but would ring in the wrong apartment.\n\n**Reference**: Trehan, S. K., Model, Z., & Lee, S. K.

The antihidrotic mode of action is not known exactly, the tannins contained may be involved.\n\n> In the case of focal hyperhidrosis, patting with Salbeitinktur (50 vol.% ethanol) is recommended in folk medicine.\n\n> For generalised sweating, tea infusions with sage leaves are helpful: pour 150 ml boiling water over a teaspoon of cut leaves (2g) or a filter bag, allow to infuse for 10 minutes, strain, drink a cup of cooled tea three times a day for two to four weeks.\n\n> In addition, there is a finished drug with aqueous sage leaf dry extract. For day sweat, for example during the menopause, 1 - 2 drag\u00e9es are recommended 3 times daily after meals, for nervous night sweat 2 - 4 drag\u00e9es are recommended before going to bed.\n\n> The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assigns sage leaf preparations, among other things, the traditional use to relieve excessive sweating; persons up to 18 years of age, pregnant women and nursing mothers should be excluded due to lack of examination data.\n\n> The available clinical studies are always open, most of which were already carried out in the 1930s in patients with TB, for example, or in healthy volunteers.\n\n> They all support the long-standing assumption that aqueous sage leaf extracts inhibit perspiration in hyperhidrosis.\n\n> In an open, uncontrolled study, 40 patients with idiopathic hyperhidrosis received an aqueous dry extract (440mg, corresponding to 2.6g sage leaves) and a further 40 patients received sage tea (4.5g leaves per day).\n\n> Sweat secretion dropped to less than 50 percent in both groups.\n\n> A therapy trial with sage leaf extract is therefore justified in patients with idiopathic focal or generalized hyperhidrosis.\n\n> [\"Mit Salbei gegen Hyperhidrose\", \u00c4rzte Zeitung, 2014][7] \n\nBut that professor is obviously a fan of herbals and mostly quotes very old studies.

In younger children hypothyroidism is most often congenital. So yes, you almost certainly have hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\n\nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is an [autoimmune disease][2]. This means that *something* triggers the immune system to produce antibodies that cross-react with normal parts of the body. People with Hashimoto\u2019s disease can have antibodies in the blood to various components of the thyroid gland. The most common are *anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies*. You may have had a blood test for this and you could certainly ask your family doctor or endocrinologist. Either way, the treatment is similar to other causes; namely replacement of thyroid hormones with *levothyroxine*.\n\n**Autoimmune disease in general**\n\nThe origins of autoimmune disease seem to be a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors and possibly pathogens. Much autoimmune disease is due to various forms of immune [hypersensitivity][3]. Specifically, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is an example of [type 4 hypersensitivity][4] (along with coeliac disease and multiple sclerosis), while [type 1][5] causes most allergies and anaphylaxis.\n\nA good example is autoimmune disease after infection by [Group A streptococcus][6] bacteria (a common cause of throat infections, skin infections, [scarlet fever][7] etc). In some people, the antibodies that the body makes against streptococcus will cross-react with other body tissues and damage them, causing a number of conditions: \n\n - [Rheumatic fever][8] and rheumatic heart disease ([type 2 hypersensitivity][9])\n - [Glomerulonephritis][10] ([type 3 hypersensitivity][11])\n - [Guttate psoriasis][12]\n - [Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS)][13]\n\nSee [this paper][14] for more information about autoimmunity after streptococcal infection. This is an example of [type 3 hypersensitivity][11].\n\n**Other Points**\n\nVarious autoimmune diseases are associated with one another. Having one can make another more likely. For example, there is a link between [type 1 diabetes][15] and autoimmune hypothyroidism. You mention that you may have lupus, which is also autoimmune. \n\nYou also mention fibromyalgia. Currently, fibromyalgia is *not* thought to be an autoimmune condition. [Proposals][16] of an autoimmune cause have not yielded evidence of this in research. It is likely to result from a complex interplay of internal and external factors with neurochemisty and neurophysiological processes. There is some overlap in symptoms, but this is not surprising as pain, stiffness, fatigue and low energy are some of the most common symptoms there are and can have many causes.\n\nI see from [another question][17] of yours that you had a bad experience with a general practitioner taking the very outdated view that fibromyalgia is not a real condition! It most certainly is real, even if not well understood yet, and can cause a lot of suffering. Whatever the underlying cause turns out to be (there may be several), it does not have to have an autoimmune origin to be real! :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/120937-overview#a4\n  [2]: https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-diseases\n  [3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity\n  [4]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_IV_hypersensitivity\n  [5]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_hypersensitivity\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A_streptococcal_infection\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatic_fever\n  [9]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_hypersensitivity\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_proliferative_glomerulonephritis\n  [11]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_III_hypersensitivity\n  [12]: https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/types/guttate\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANDAS\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333434/\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15082086/\n  [17]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/9660/why-do-some-general-practioners-not-consider-fibromyalgia-as-a-genuine-real-aut", "17352": "Essentially this depends on which specific protein a person is allergic too. There will be a lot of crossover in plants so closely related as to be different subspecies of the same species, but some proteins may be unique.\n\nFollowing your example of corn, this is taken from an interesting 2012 paper on the [Molecular Features of Maize Allergens and their Implications in Human Health][1]:\n\n>Detailed biochemical knowledge of maize allergy is lacking. There are several unanswered questions including the symptoms and mechanisms involved in maize allergenic reactions, its prevalence in adults and children, the implicated allergen molecules and the clinical cross-sensitization. Therefore, diagnostic tests and maize allergy management constitute a field of great interest. Currently, maize allergen proteins are classified into 20 different families, displaying diverse structures and functions. They are responsible for many IgE cross-reactions between unrelated pollen and plant food allergen sources. The most relevant maize allergen molecules belong to the Expansin and the Ole e 1 superfamilies, the panallergen Profilin, and the Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs), i.e. Zea m 14, the major maize allergen.\n\nThis is clearly a complex area, with ongoing research.\n\nYou mention sweet corn vs popping corn, which are different subspecies of *Zea mays*. Interestingly, [sweet corn][2] is sweet because of a recessive mutation that reduces the conversion of sugar to starch.\n\nHeating a food can [denature][3] proteins, reducing their bio activity. It is possible that the act of popping corn might reduce allergenicity somewhat.\n\nIn a [Review of Food Processing and Allergenicity][4], peanuts, tree nuts, cows' milk, hens' eggs, soy, wheat and mustard were reviewed. It was found that:\n\n - Processing may influence, but does not abolish, the allergenic potential of proteins.\n - Reduction of allergenicity by fermentation and hydrolysis are the best characterised.\n\n[**Cross-reactivity**][5]\n\nThere is also cross-reactivity, in which allergy to one protein results in an allergy to another similar protein in a completely different species (e.g. apples and birch pollen). This results in types of allergy like [oral allergy syndrome][6].\n\nAll allergies are mediated by an immune system dysfunction known as [type 1 hypersensitivity][7]. Other types of hypersensitivity are responsible for other reactions and autoimmune conditions.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228328388_Molecular_Features_of_Maize_Allergens_and_their_Implications_in_Human_Health\n  [2]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_corn\n  [3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)\n  [4]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691515000848\n  [5]: https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-dictionary/cross-reactivity\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_hypersensitivity", "17344": "## Background\nMuscarinic acetylcholine receptors, or\u00a0mAChRs, are\u00a0acetylcholine receptors\u00a0that form\u00a0G protein-coupled receptor complexes\u00a0in the\u00a0cell membranes\u00a0of certain\u00a0neurons ([Eglen, 2006][1])\u00a0and other\u00a0cells.

Since thioridazine binds with similar high affinities to muscarinic receptors as olanzapine and clozapine, muscarinic autoreceptor blockade was ruled out as a primary mechanism ([Shirazi-Southall, et al. 2002][5]).

Reports indicate that masturbation can help relieve menstrual cramps.\n\nd) Masturbation can help strengthen muscle tone in the pelvic and anal areas, which can reduce the chances of incontinence and uterine prolapse.

However, to date no studies have been published examining how British parents conceptualise the notion of \u2018immune-overload\u2019 or how they relate this concept to their own children. Eighteen focus groups were conducted with parents between November 2002 and March 2003. **[....]** We conclude that although there is no scientific evidence that supports parents\u2019 fears about combined vaccines causing \u2018immune-overload\u2019, policy makers need to recognise these concerns if they are to successfully persuade parents that combined vaccines are safe.\n\nThere is also [Offit, et al. (2002)][2].\n>Recent surveys found that an increasing number of parents are concerned that infants receive too many vaccines. Implicit in this concern is that the infant\u2019s immune system is inadequately developed to handle vaccines safely or that multiple vaccines may overwhelm the immune system. In this review, we will examine the following: 1) the ontogeny of the active immune response and the ability of neonates and young infants to respond to vaccines; 2) the theoretic capacity of an infant\u2019s immune system; 3) data that demonstrate that mild or moderate illness does not interfere with an infant\u2019s ability to generate protective immune responses to vaccines; 4) how infants respond to vaccines given in combination compared with the same vaccines given separately; 5) data showing that vaccinated children are not more likely to develop infections with other pathogens than unvaccinated children; and 6) the fact that infants actually encounter fewer antigens in vaccines today than they did 40 or 100 years ago.\n\nIn summary, they said\n>Current studies do not support the hypothesis that multiple vaccines overwhelm, weaken, or \u201cuse up\u201d the immune system. On the contrary, young infants have an enormous capacity to respond to multiple vaccines, as well as to the many other challenges present in the environment. By providing protection against a number of bacterial and viral pathogens, vaccines **prevent** the \u201cweakening\u201d of the immune system and consequent secondary bacterial infections occasionally caused by natural infection.\n\n<h2>References</h2>\nHilton, S., Petticrew, M., & Hunt, K.

One question is how to you would go about operationalising libido in males? For example, one could argue that an intervention that gives a male an erection in the absence of any visual sexual stimuli is for all intents and purposes, an aphrodisiac. \n\nPT-141 (bremelanotide) does seem to have these properties:\n\n> **[Evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of subcutaneously administered PT-141, a melanocortin receptor agonist, in healthy male subjects and in patients with an inadequate response to Viagra\u00ae][1]**\n\n\n> PT-141, a cyclic heptapeptide melanocortin analog, was evaluated following subcutaneous administration to healthy male subjects and to patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) who report an inadequate response to Viagra\u00ae.

The erectogenic potential of PT-141, its tolerability profile and its ability to cause significant erections in patients who do not have an adequate response to a PDE5 inhibitor suggest that PT-141 may provide an alternative treatment for ED with a potentially broad patient base.\n\n\n> If some pheromone were effective in increasing libido in men then I would've expected to see a huge market for it and perhaps big pharma creating products that combine PDE5 inhibitors like \"Viagra\" with pheromones. \n\nYou're correct here.

One should not confuse raging passions for getting a [raging clue][3]. This is not a trivial point:\n\n> **[The Subjective Sexual Arousal Scale for Men (SSASM): Preliminary Development and Psychometric Validation of a Multidimensional Measure of Subjective Male Sexual Arousal][4]** \n\n> **Male sexual arousal has been historically\ndescribed as a central physiological state, with\npenile erection in a sexual context as its most valid\nobjective measure [21]**. Bancroft de\ufb01nes sexual\narousal as a state that is motivated toward experi-\nencing sexual pleasure and possibly orgasm, which\ninvolves the processing of relevant stimuli, general\narousal, incentive motivation, and genital response\n[22]. A multifaceted process of male sexual arousal\nis supported by functional magnetic resonance\nimaging data indicating different patterns of brain\nstimulation during sexual arousal, penile tumes-\ncence, and penile erection in healthy male volun-\nteers [23]. **Furthermore, studies in men without\nsexual dysfunction have demonstrated that penile\nerection is not always highly associated with sub-\njective mental aspects of sexual arousal [24,25].\nBased on these \ufb01ndings, a lack of subjective sexual\narousal may explain why some men with ED fail to\nrespond to treatment with PDE5 inhibitors\ndespite having the physiological ability to achieve\nand maintain an erection.**\n\nHowever, my reference to the role of exogenous testosterone may more accurately reflect what is meant by \"libido\" or sexual desire.\n\n\n###**Exogenous testosterone**###\n\nAlternatively, you might have some measure of sexual interest in males, in which case administration of exogenous testosterone displays efficacy in this regard:\n\n> **[The effects of exogenous testosterone on sexuality and mood of normal men][5]** \n\n> The effects of supraphysiological levels of testosterone, used for male contraception, on sexual behavior and mood were studied in a single-blind, placebo-controlled manner in a group of 31 normal men. After 4 weeks of baseline observations, the men were randomized into two groups: one group received 200 mg testosterone enanthate (TE) weekly by im injection for 8 weeks (Testosterone Only group), the other received placebo injections once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by TE 200 mg weekly for the following 4 weeks (Placebo/Testosterone group). The testosterone administration increased trough plasma testosterone levels by 80%, compatible with peak testosterone levels 400-500% above baseline. Various aspects of sexuality were assessed using sexuality experience scales (SES) questionnaires at the end of each 4-week period while sexual activity and mood states were recorded by daily dairies and self-rating scales. **In both groups there was a significant increase in scores in the Psychosexual Stimulation Scale of the SES (i.e. SES 2) following testosterone administration, but not with placebo.** There were no changes in SES 3, which measures aspects of sexual interaction with the partner. In both groups there were no changes in frequency of sexual intercourse, masturbation, or penile erection on waking nor in any of the moods reported. **The Placebo/Testosterone group showed an increase in self-reported interest in sex during testosterone treatment but not with placebo. The SES 2 results suggest that sexual awareness and arousability can be increased by supraphysiological levels of testosterone.** However, these changes are not reflected in modifications of overt sexual behavior, which in eugonadal men may be more determined by sexual relationship factors. This contrasts with hypogonadal men, in whom testosterone replacement clearly stimulates sexual behavior. There was no evidence to suggest an alteration in any of the mood states studied, in particular those associated with increased aggression. We conclude that supraphysiological levels of testosterone maintained for up to 2 months can promote some aspects of sexual arousability without stimulating sexual activity in eugonadal men within stable heterosexual relationships. Raising testosterone does not increase self-reported ratings of aggressive feelings.\n\nIf we consider both testosterone and PT-141 in tandem, *sexual awareness* and *sexual arousal* can be dissociated from one another.\n\n###**Dopaminergic stimulants e.g. meth/amphetamine**###\n\nThere is some evidence from animal studies to suggest that amphetamine increases libido, as operationalised by frequency of sex. Again, I could suffer from the same folly as above where I confuse libido for some other construct, but this is also supported by subjective reports among meth users who like to have sex with other dudes. However, I will need to dig up some references.\n\n> Former Nobel laureates and other researchers at Harvard awarded the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize to the creators of the \"gay bomb\" -- a non-lethal military weapon under development intended to induce demoralizing homosexual behavior with aphrodisiacs. \n\nIf the above regarding amphetamines is correct, it would be hilarious to see what effect acute administration of methamphetamine among a male prison population would be. \n\n###**Marketability of aphrodisiacs in general**###\n\nOne problem is that the current milieu within which drugs are evaluated by the FDA is that a drug will only be approved for sale if it can treat a disease. Any use of the term \"aphrodisiac\" is effectively a no-no. What I imagine would happen is that eventually the diagnostic criteria for erectile dysfunction would be relaxed considerably, or some equivalent of *sexual arousal disorder* for males would enter into the vernacular.\n\nI'm a little surprised that recreational use of some combination of testosterone/methamphetamine/PT-141/PDE-5 inhibitors as some sort of sex aid isn't \"a thing\". Well, I'm sure it is somewhere in the world.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.nature.com/articles/3901200\n  [2]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2004.10.060\n  [3]: https://youtu.be/lcHy8xEt2QI\n  [4]: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02319.x\n  [5]: https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.75.6.1464655", "16571": "Ibuprofen and Aspirin [are both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=M01AE&showdescription=no). These NSAIDs can be differentiated into selective NSAIDs and non-selective NSAIDs. \n\nNon-selective NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen and Aspirin are both COX-1 [*Cyclooxygenase-1, also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS-1)*] and COX-2 inhibitors [*Cyclooxygenase-2 respectively*]. (For the sake of completion: Selective NSAIDs only inhibit COX-2).\n\nBoth PTGS inhibitors prevent prostaglandin synthesis, which is a hormone amongst many other functions responsible for transmitting pain to the brain. \n\nHowever, because [a study from 2008][1] notes that COX-1 promotes the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach and contributes to reduced acid secretion and reduced pepsin content, (and hence an inhibitor such as all non-selective NSAIDs will decrease said mucus), [PTGS-1 inhibitors increase the *risk of serious gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration*][2] (and other stomach-upsetting symptoms).\n\nHence it is recommended to consume such non-selective NSAIDs with food, [because this will allegedly lessen the symptoms][3]. \n\nIt used to be \"mandatory\" to eat food before taking such medicine, but in 2015, [the Australian Medicines Handbook has stepped back from this standpoint and now only encourages taking it with water and eating only if it does in fact upset one's stomach.][4] A [study published in 2007][5] has already found that the negative side-effects are dosage and time-dependent. [Furthermore, a more recent study from 2015 found that the effect of food might not be as positive as expected.][6]\n\nSo, this seems to be a pretty mixed bag.

Some men recover the ability to have an erection over time, as tissues heal.  \n\nHowever, because the men are not having regular erections, there isn't enough blood flow into the penis to maintain healthy tissues.  For this reason, many urologists will prescribe a daily dose of Cialis (tadalafil) to maintain the health of the penis, and promote healing.\n\nThis is an \"off label\" use of Cialis.  The urologists are prescribing it for something other than its intended and approved purpose.  And the manufacturers cannot claim that it is effective for this purpose, because the FDA has not approved it.  \n\nSo, the idea that Cialis might encourage healing and regeneration of erectile tissues by maintaining healthy blood flow is well known, despite lack of FDA approvals, or manufacturer claims.\n\nOf course, it would be premature to jump to conclusions based on a single study; it's important to understand how clinical studies work, and especially how they relate to FDA approval for specific uses (in the United States).  \n\n----------\n\n**Citations**\n\n[Erectile preservation following radical prostatectomy][1]\n\n[Tadalafil therapy for erectile dysfunction following prostatectomy][2]\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126086/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4485415/\n", "16356": "The aging process itself can cause a stiffening of the blood vessels; also our genes, etc. In general, for people with hypertension, more potassium is better.

As was shown by the LIFE study ([Pahor,&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2014][3]), aerobic exercise can also decrease functional decline in lower limb muscles. Exercise has also been shown to be an important therapeutic approach to reversing frailty. There is evidence to support that excess protein [1\u20131.2 g (kj day)] may also enhance muscle mass and, to a lesser extent, function ([Bauer,&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;2013][4]). This is particularly true for leucine enriched essential amino acids (whey protein). Essential amino acid supplementation prevents muscle mass loss due to bed rest. A recent multicenter study has shown that whey protein together with vitamin D increased both muscle mass and stair climb. There is some evidence for synergistic effects of exercise and protein to enhance muscle function. Vitamin D supplementation increases muscle strength without increasing muscle mass or power. Vitamin D is more effective in older persons and those with low vitamin D levels. It also decreases falls in persons who are vitamin D deficient. At present, no drugs have been shown to be clinically more therapeutically effective.\n\nFor exercise and diet there is the following from [Waters,&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;(2010)][5]\n\n>With exception of ACEI as a pharmaceutical intervention, the most compelling evidence to combat sarcopenia is resistance training either alone or in combination with nutritional supplements.\n\nFor anabolic steroids/SARMs, [Morley (2016)][1], states that with:\n\n - **Nandrolone**<br>there is no evidence that it increased strength\n - **MK<sub>0773</sub> (TFM-<sub>4</sub>AS-<sub>1</sub>)**<br>a <sub>4</sub>-aza steroidal drug that has androgen gene selectivity.

I cannot find the article I was thinking of, but the linked Wikipedia page provides information on this with citations.\n\n> In medicine, the hygiene hypothesis is a hypothesis that states a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents, symbiotic microorganisms (such as the gut flora or probiotics), and parasites increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of immune tolerance.\n>\nThe hygiene hypothesis has also been called the \"[biome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome) depletion theory\" and the \"lost friends theory\" <sup>[1]</sup>.\n>\n...\n>\nAlthough the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of allergy is not new, Strachan was one of the first to formally propose it, in an article published in the British Medical Journal in 1989. <sup>[21]</sup>\n>\n**Citations**\n>\n[1] William Parker (2010-10-13).

If [conducted in non-Chinese][1] [contexts the results][2] are most of the time quite underwhelming or more [reason for concern][3] than [anything][4] like \"encouraging\". Way too often the theory behind the treatments appears flaky, the evidence for effectiveness regarding desired results is weak and the [dangers posed by unregulated and uncontrolled substances][5] ingested looks quite big.\n\n> Has any proof ever been found for Qi energy?\n\nNone. [TCM][6] is very much [incompatible][7] with Western tradition of scientific thinking and explanation. What has been found, ***occasionally***, is that *despite* a \u2013 [from a Western viewpoint][8] \u2013 complete garbage perspective concerning the underlying theory, some treatments offered by TCM appear to be effective. But remember that effective and efficient might be two different things here.\n\nMany of the herbs, animals [*and metals*][9] employed are recognised to be pharmacologically relevant. That is 'active'; but often unproven to be more beneficial than detrimental. \n\nIf evidence based medicine oriented studies are undertaken, they analyse the effects of [the herbs and other methods][6] according to Western scientific standards, \"Qi\" is not featured there.\n\nSomeone offering a diagnose *and* selling a treatment in the way described in the question is not only *highly* unethical but also [quite unlikely][10] to be correct, even according to [TCM standards][11].\n\n\nOne such study that examines TCM a style remedy for anxiety according to western standards (althogh not in humans) is\n> [Antianxiety-like effects of Chimpi (dried citrus peels) in the elevated open-platform test:][12]\n> Dried citrus peels (Chimpi) is one of the most common natural medicines with qi (energy flow) rectifying and shi (dampness) drying actions, which originates from Citrus unshiu, and/or C. reticulata according to the definition of the pharmacopoeiae of Japan and China. In this study, the pharmacological effects of their extracts and major chemical constituents hesperidin and its aglycone hesperetin on anxiety were examined with an anxiety model of elevated open-platform test using ICR male mice (6-week-old) and total duration of freezing was decreased in fluoxetine-treated mice, which is a simple and highly sensitive to the effects of serotonergic anxiolytics. Moreover, yokukansankachimpihange (YKH), a combination of yokukansan with Chimpi and Hange (Pinellia) was also examined because Chimpi is considered to play a crucial part in this formula against anxious symptoms in dementia patients. The results showed that Chimpi and YKH possess a significant anxiolytic-like effect similar to that of fluoxetine, suggesting that they might be similar to fluoxetine in their pharmacological actions through the serotonergic neurotransmission pathway. Moreover, it also suggested that the major chemical constituent, hesperidin could be an active principle attributed to the antianxiety-like effects with a direct and indirect role via its aglycone hesperetin.\n\nNote the amount of weasel words and speculation displayed in this *in vivo* test. \"Qi\" is only mentioned as an organising principle with the originating system of medicine, the actual action displayed is then tried to be translatable into Western standard medical language and reasoning.

Bacteria have lived on the Earth for several billion years. During this time, they encountered in nature a wide range of naturally occurring antibiotics. To survive, bacteria developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have become resistant to most of the natural antimicrobial agents that have been developed over the past 50 years. This resistance increasingly limits the effectiveness of current antimicrobial drugs. The problem is not just antibiotic resistance but also multidrug resistance. [From: [Microbial drug discovery: 80 years of progress][1]]\n\nThat means the [Penicillium roqueforti][2] is in a constant fight with bacteria since 'forever' using its antibiotics to gain the upper hand when used in cheese. Those bacteria responsible for any infection coming into contact with those antibiotics and surviving the encounter will be somehow more resistant to those chemicals than before the encounter. They may have very well been resistant to those before. \n\n>  [These survivors may be naturally resistant to the antibiotic ingested, or they may have acquired resistance during therapy. Sometimes the patient was already colonized with resistant organisms before treatment had even begun.][3] \n\nAnd this is of a very small concern because blue cheese mould are not producing antibiotics or other chemicals of use as a medical agent for pathogenic human infections with bacteria. Those [chemicals][4] are either [very weak][5] or in [very low][6] concentrations.\n\nPenicillium is a very large group of species and not every member of this family produces useful drugs. Resistance to antibiotics is an evolutionary process and evolution favours minimalism in regard to developing new features. Eating these cheeses, if properly prepared and stored, should not increase resistance against prescription drugs we use currently under the term antibiotics. \n\nSo, after detailing some very nit-picky technicalities let me clarify my opening statement to: No.  These cheeses will not cause problems with resistance to prescription drugs.\n\n  [1]: https://www.nature.com/ja/journal/v62/n1/full/ja200816a.html\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium_roqueforti\n  [3]: http://www.springer.com/de/book/9780387708409\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefortine_C\n  [5]: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arved_Lompe/publication/291983856_Die_gesundheitliche_Unbedenklichheit_von_Penicillium_caseicolum_P_camemberti_and_P_roqueforti_II_Biologische_Prufung_auf_Toxinbildungsvermogen_an_Zellkulturen_The_harmlessness_to_health_of_Penicillium/links/56af4d9308aeaa696f2fe2ce/Die-gesundheitliche-Unbedenklichheit-von-Penicillium-caseicolum-P-camemberti-and-P-roqueforti-II-Biologische-Pruefung-auf-Toxinbildungsvermoegen-an-Zellkulturen-The-harmlessness-to-health-of-Penicill.pdf\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2231314", "14153": "This has to be a speculative answer. [Putting a Number on Smoking\u2019s Toll][1]?\nImportant is this: \n> People who quit between 25 and 34 years of age *gained about 10 years of life* compared to those who continued to smoke.\n\nPositive changes are not to be discounted. And stopping reduces risks.\n\n> [Many current and former smokers want to know their risk of developing lung cancer in numbers. For example, some people want information such as \"I have a 10% chance of developing the disease.\" Assigning a number to risk is very complicated and is often hard to interpret \u2013 while one person may think 10% is a high chance, another thinks that is a relatively low number. And for the person who is in that 10% and develops the cancer, the number is meaningless. Remember that statistics like these are numbers based on large groups of people. It can be difficult to translate what that means for any one individual. In other words, don't let the number convince you that it is okay to continue smoking.][2]\n\n>- 5 years after quitting <br>\nYour risk of stroke is reduced to that of a non-smoker 2-5 years after quitting. The risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus and bladder is cut in half after 5 years. (US Surgeon General's Report, 2010)\n\n>- 10 years after quitting<br>\nThe lung cancer death rate is about half that of a person who is still smoking. (US Surgeon General's Report, 2010)\n\n>- 15 years after quitting<br>\nThe risk of coronary heart disease is that of a non-smoker's. (US Surgeon General's Report, 1990)\n\nThese are findings just about a subgroup of risks and they are presented to encourage people to stop smoking. Since [reduction][3] of smoking or smoking cessation seems always [beneficial][4], this is much more motivating and indeed a positive outlook. The longer you live *after you stop* smoking, the stronger the [reduction of risks][5] related to [smoking][6]. \n\nBut that is not precisely what is asked for here. Calculating the reduced life expectancy by simply subtracting the risks or reductions mentioned above does not work very well. (Of course you can always do the math, but numbers can get meaningless.)\n\n\nThe calculation of expected negativity just criticised may be done as follows:\n[Time for a smoke? One cigarette reduces your life by 11 minutes][7]:\n\n10 years x 365 days x 20 cigarettes = 73000 cowboy moments \n\n73000 cm x 11 rf = 803000 minutes lr\n\n\n\nExact calculations for the risks of an individual are impossible. Also keep in mind that the above calculation is based on just one paper, that only assigned and calculated numbers. That is quite different from measuring it. And applied to everyone the above formula is very imprecise, since there are many contributing factors, like [age of smoking initiation][8], simply left out.\n\nTo look at the first quote from another perspective:\n\n> [Life Expectancy][9]\n\n> - If a smoker quits before age 35, their life expectancy is the same as non-smokers.\n> - If a smoker quits between the age of 35 and 65, add 5 years to their life expectancy as compared to others who continues to smoke.\n> - If a smoker quits between the age of 65 and 74, add 1 year to their life expectancy as compared to someone who continues to smoke.\n\n\n  [1]: https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/putting-a-number-to-smokings-toll/\n  [2]: https://www.oncolink.org/risk-and-prevention/smoking-tobacco-and-cancer/former-smokers-and-cancer-risk\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613764\n  [4]: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/smo/benefits\n  [5]: https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/news/20080506/quit-smoking-death-risk-drops-fast#1\n  [6]: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1117323/\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581335\n  [9]: http://www.stopsmokingcenter.net/education/benefits.aspx", "14120": "The Hepatitis B core antibody test is positive for IgG but negative for IgM indicating that you had the hepatitis B infection a while ago.

These are common side effects.\n\nYou should also talk with your primary care physician.  They can do the endocrinology tests for prolactin and/or testosterone IF they feel they are appropriate.  They will likely ask that you discuss your meds with your psychiatrist as well, as they are the experts.\n \nAnother possibility is to talk with a urologist, who are the experts in male genitalia and everything about them.  But a primary care doctor is generally better at putting the whole-person picture together, if you have additional medical issues that are not being addressed. \n\nA sexologist is not a medical doctor (at least in my understanding it is a branch of psychology) and as such is not going to be able to do those tests or prescribe anything like testosterone - if that is necessary.  They are, however, extremely helpful in addressing all other contributing factors to low libido and erectile dysfunction!\n\n**An important point:**\n\nThis is not medical advice; talk everything over with your physician before making changes, and for anything regarding your unique situation.\n\nBut overall, managing schizophrenia is paramount to anything else, as uncontrolled symptoms affect ALL quality of life aspects not just sex.

We included prospective cohort studies that assessed the relation of fructose-containing sugars with incident type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random effects meta-analyses. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.\n\nRESULTS: Fifteen prospective cohort studies (251 261 unique participants, 16 416 cases) met the eligibility criteria, comparing the highest intake (median 137, 35.2 and 78 g/d) with the lowest intake (median 65, 9.7 and 25.8 g/d) of total sugars, fructose and sucrose, respectively. Although there was no association of total sugars (RR 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.09) or fructose (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.29) with type 2 diabetes, sucrose was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98). Our confidence in the estimates was limited by evidence of serious inconsistency between studies for total sugars and fructose, and serious imprecision in the pooled estimates for all 3 sugar categories.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Current evidence does not allow us to conclude that fructose-containing sugars independent of food form are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Further research is likely to affect our estimates.\n\n----------\n\nCITATION: Reeds, J., Mansuri, S., Mamakeesick, M., Harris, S. B., Zinman, B., Gittelsohn, J., \u2026 Hanley, A. (2016).

It only concerns itself with the imaginary scenario of two identical subjects following the same total calorie diet but with macro-nutritional differences.*\n\n----------------------------\n\n# Are Carbohydrates fattening?\n\nThe question asks if carbohydrates lead to more fatty mass gain than the other macronutrients: fat and protein (and alchohol), if consumed at the same calorie level. \n\nTo put it another way: **For weight change, does the macro-nutritional profile of a diet affect the rate and total amount of fat mass gained?**\n\nThe common tautology employed by people proving that macro-nutritional profile is not important when it comes to weight loss is \"a calorie is a calorie\".\n\n# Evidence For, or \"A calorie is a calorie\"\n\n**[Several metabolic ward studies have shown that there is no difference in weight loss when protein intake was held constant.][1]** If you're really looking for a metabolic advantage through manipulating macronutrient, you'd be far better off putting your money on protein. There's actually some evidence that higher intake levels do convey a small metabolic advantage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the studies into macronutrient impact on mass change are numerous but by no means perfect.

One origin may be a 1945 recommendation that stated: A suitable allowance of water for adults is 2.5 litres daily in most instances.

Recently, two distinct studies have shown that low dose aspirin did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of gastrointestinal bleeding risk compared to other NSAID [2][2][3][3]. While I couldn\u2019t find a study providing evidence regarding the relationship between time-exposure to NSAID + ASA and the occurrence of adverse event, the co-administration of NSAID and low dose aspirin should be taken with caution. Moreover, even in patients not under aspirin, **long term use of NSAID is not recommended** (both for its lack of long term analgesic effect as well as potential cardiovascular and renal side effects)[4][4].\n\n> What is the best nsaid choice for this situation and how should they\n> be taken (in different hour/ dosage adjustment)\n\n**Several strategies can be used**. Here current recommendations [1][1][2][2]:\n\n - using anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs that have minimal effects on COX-1 at usual doses, such as acetaminophen (=paracetamol), or non-acetylated salicylates\n - for very short term use of NSAID, prescribing either a potent inhibitor of gastric acid production such as a proton pump inhibitor or a prostaglandin E analog such as misoprostol together with the NSAID.\n - as suggested by *@M.

In particular because, to my knowledge, no study so far has provided sufficient evidence regarding the use of rivaroxaban in the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, rivaroxaban is probably one of the DOAC which showed the most unconvincing results regarding major bleeding outcomes (as well as clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) in the studies assessing its safety and efficacy in patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation [8][8].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity?source=see_link\n  [2]: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460554\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035129\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096211/\n  [6]: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17669925\n  [8]: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/855158", "7431": "[Amyl Nitrite][1]\n\n> Treats and prevents chest pain (angina pectoris).\n\nAnd more pertinent for the question:\n\n> On the street, this medicine and others like it are sometimes called\n> \"poppers.\" They have been used by some people to cause a \"high\" or to\n> improve sex.

White blood cells (macrophages) \"clean\" the wound - the wound may appear to be oozing some fluid. Blood flow increases, the macrophages produce growth factors. \n 3. Blood flow increases more, red blood cells deliver more oxygen. Cells at the edge of the wound secrete *collagen*. The wound fills with tissue called *granulation tissue*. \n 4. New skin grows over that tissue. \n\nThese stages are called hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. This process can take weeks to years depending on size and location of the wound. \n\nNow, what's a scar? Scars look different from \"normal\" skin because of *collagen*. Collagen is a protein on the outside of the skin cells holding them together and making skin strong (it's also a major part of tendons). In normal skin the collagen sort of forms a \"criss-cross\" pattern, while in scar tissue it's more parallel.

There is a lot of literature about consumption of these oils in general ([an example about cardiovascular risk][3]) but relatively few about fatty acid supplementation by pills in particular. \n\nEdit to take count of the article you cited:\n\n - According to the Mayo Clinic article cited previously, it's the reverse, rapeseed oil is dangerous while canola oil isn't.\n - Canola oil can be hydrogenated, like all oils, but it's not always the case. Here, the pill bottle indicated 0g of trans fat, which indicates that the oil used in the pills isn't hydrogenated. But the law in the US allow companies to write 0g as long as it's under 0,5g so it might not be really trans fat-free. The term cold-pressed normally means the oil hasn't been heated, and thus isn't hydrogenated.\nFinally, I can't find a clear mention of whether indicating if an oil is hydrogenated is mandatory in the US or not, but the FDA (which banned trans fats in June) and the Mayo Clinic do recommend checking it to avoid trans fats, which seem to mean it's mandatory.\nBased on all this, I would think the canola oil in these pills isn't hydrogenated.\n - There is no GMO labeling in the US.

If anything isn't covered or is unclear, please leave a comment. \n\n> 1) Initial Consultation \n\nThat is, I assume, just the initial doctor's visit - taking your wife's health history, weight, blood pressure, etc. That is, of course, completely reasonable. \n\n> 2) Initial Consult - Fetal Medicine\n\nI am not completely sure what is meant with this. It might be giving you information on how to have a healthy pregnancy (what to do, what to avoid), or on how to deal with problems with the fetus if they occur. I'd need more information on this. \n\n>3) Follow up Visits -(11 visits)\n\nReasonable. Over the course of 36 weeks (from initial visit to estimated due date), a normal schedule for a healthy is one visit every month until the last trimester, where visits might be every two and later every week (when going over the due date, for example). One visit during month 3, 4, 5, 6 = 4 visits. Every two weeks during months 7, 8, and 9= about 7,which works out to more or less 11. It could also be 12  or more if problems arise or there are risk factors, but I am assuming a pregnancy with no risk factors here. For comparison, the NHS lists [10 such visits in its example schedule][2].The [NIH lists a few more, with one weekly appointment in the last month. ][2]\n\n> 4) Routine Laboratory tests: \n> a) CBC -(2 tests)\n\nYes, reasonable. This is a complete blood count, for detecting things like anemia (low hemoglobin), which can be used problem during pregnancy, or high infection markers. [Again, the NHS has more information on this][3] (they call it FBC - full blood count) .\n\n> b) Blood Type & Antibody\n\nBlood Type - reasonable. At the very least you need to know your wife's rhesus type to know if  [rhesus incompatibility][4] could be a problem.\n\n\"Antibody\" is not enough information. I'd need to know what antibody tests this means.\n\n> c) HIV \n\nHIV status is usually checked during pregnancy to prevent  [passing HIV to the child][5]. \n\n> d) Hepatitis B\n\n[Same with hepatitis B][6]\n\n> e) Rubella \n\nRubella infection during pregnancy is [very dangerous for the fetus][7], checking whether the mother is immune helps determining whether the mother needs to be careful to stay away from people who might have it.\n\n> f) C/S Urine \n\nThis is for diagnosing urinary tract infections. I think it might be argued whether this is really necessary to do at the beginning of a pregnancy, but it's also not invasive and treating a UTI means it can't turn into a worse infection. \n\n> g) Urinalysis Dip Sticks \u2013 ( 11 Sticks )\n\nReasonable. A Urinalysis at every visit can detect issues such as [diabetes, kidney problems, or pre-eclampsia][8]. These issues need to be treated, and can turn dangerous (especially pre-eclampsia). \n\n> 5) Ultra Sound Examinations -( 3 Scans) \n\nThree ultrasound examinations are standard [with the NHS][2]. More may be needed for complicated pregnancies. Ultrasounds are [not harmful for baby or mother][10]. This seems reasonable. \n\n> 6) Glucose Screening\n\nThis is screening for pregnancy/gestational diabetes. As mentioned above, diabetes during pregnancy [can be dangerous], but can be treated when detected. It's only recommended by [the NHS][11] [and the Mayo Clinic][12] if risk factors are present.

They are administered via intravenous route and hence can be give by nurses or paramedical personnel. The drug travels in the blood stream to reach arteries of the heart and lyses the thrombus (clot) there. Thrombolysis treatement can be given in ambulance while patients are being transported to hospitals or even at patient's home to save time. Tenecteplase, a type of thrombolytic therapy, can be given just as a bolus injection and does not even need infusion. Early after onset of heart attack, the thrombus is soft and possibly smaller in size and hence is more easily lysed by thrombolytic agents.\n\nOn the other hand, primary angioplasty needs a fully functioning cardiac catheterization laboratory which costs a lot and are available only in tertiary centers. Trained cardiologists and cath lab technician/nursing staff are needed to perform primary angioplasty. The access has to be through high pressure artery rather than simple vein for thrombolysis. The procedure itself is very complex since the coronary arteries of the heart have to be hooked, wires, balloon catheters, thrombo-suction devices and stents have to be passed into them to open the block caused by thrombus. The logistics of availablity are difficult, especially at nights and on weekends. Hence, the costs are also much more with primary angioplasty. \n\nBecause of all these reasons, we should not ignore the role of thrombolytic therapy in patients presenting early after onset of chest pain in acute heart attack. For patients presenting late, primary angioplasty has been shown to be more beneficial than thrombolytic treatment, presumably because the thrombus become more extensive and firm with time and is not easily lysed wih thrombolytic agents (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12517460).\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.tctmd.com/show.aspx?id=123817\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1768566/\n  [3]: http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/108/23/2851.full\n  [4]: http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/ehj/30/13/1598.full.pdf\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162464\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12559941\n  [7]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1301092?viewType=Print&viewClass=Print\n  [8]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa025142", "1807": "> A doctor mentioned Helicobacter pylori as a possible culprit for both of those symptoms.\n\nH.pylori infection is a latent infection in the human stomach mucous layer [(1)][1][(2)][2]. This infection is basically asymptomatic. This infection, however, may cause chronic gastritis. Chronic gastritis is also asymptomatic in most people. Heart burn is not a typical sign of chronic gastritis. In addition to chronic gastritis, H.pylori is able to harm the protective layer in the stomach lining. Since the surroundings in stomach are very acidic (pH~2), any damage done to the protective layer predisposes to stomach ulcer since the gastric acid damages the deeper layers of the stomach lining. These ulcers are usually symptomatic and can cause heartburn and pain in the upper abdomen. NSAIDs can harm the protective layer of stomach in the same way as H.pylori and there they predispose to ulcers also.\n\nHowever, I find it very difficult to believe that helicobacter would cause migraine. There is at least [one meta-analysis][3] and [a review article][4] on this subject. Both are published in a quite questionable Open Access journal. The studies included in the meta-analysis are all quite low quality studies. [Another study][5] conducted on Iran seems quite dubious also. This study has caused some concerns, as can be seen in PubMed. \n\nThe causal relationship between H.pylori eradication and migraine can be studied quite easily and safely in large populations. As so, I am suspicious with regard to these studies since there are no randomized controlled trials published in high quality medical journals on this matter. \n\n> Are there any efficient tests to determine if one is in fact \"infected\" with the bacteria?\n\n[A quite recent review article][6] in the New England Journal of Medicine outlines the current *non-endoscopic* diagnostic modalities:\n\n - Serologic test (=a blood sample to assess for h.pylori antigens) is widely available and cheap. Remains positive even after an eradication\n - [Urea breath test][7] has high positive and negative predictive values. Results are affected by the use of proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics.\n - Fecal antigen test has also positive and negative predictive values. No the most convenient test for patients (not surprised).\n\n\n> Are treatments required when there's no presence of stomach ulcers?\n\nThere is absolutely no indication to eradicate H.pylori in patients who are totally asymptomatic. The prevalence of H.pylori infection is so high that half of the world total population should be on antibiotics. Moreover, if the eradication of H.pylori is successful, you will receive almost surely within the next weeks. If one is diagnosed with an ulcer, a reflux disease or h.pylori is seen tissue samples obtained during gastroscopy or the reason of dyspepsia is suspected to be H.pylori infection, the eradication is reasonable.\n\n  [1]: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/176938-overview#a1\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356058\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25232230\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23159967\n  [6]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp1001110\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_breath_test", "1712": "[National Institutes of Health (NIH) Medline Plus][1] website has the same recommendations as the FDA, broken down by age, sex, and pregnancy status.

(Note that some of the references are to NMES, which stands for Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation, and is considered synonymous with EMS.)\n\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) use electrotherapy to [stimulate the nerves](http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/) and active therapeutic healing. Electronic Muscle Stimulators (EMS), on the other hand, sends electric impulses that cause [muscle contraction](http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/). EMS units are used to prevent atrophied muscles, for retraining muscles (e.g. in partial paralysis), to increase range of motion, and other uses. \n\nSome of the technology is described [here](http://www.tensunitreviews.net/tens-vs-ems/). \n\n>A TENS unit uses microcurrent to increase the production of ATP, which is adenosine triphosphate and the substance that supplies energy to the body on a cellular level. Although lasting pain reduction may require regular microcurrent sessions, in some individuals the pain reduction begins to last longer and the time between sessions lengthens. This may be due to the increased circulatory action that enables the lymph system to begin clearing the body of accumulated toxins. The sensations of both the microcurrent and conventional TENS treatments are more like tingling sensations than the unpleasant feeling of a small electrical shock.\n>\n>EMS uses a cycle of stimulation, contraction and then relaxation, to increase blood flow to the area, which decreases inflammation and promotes healing and muscle growth. By stimulating the muscles at their basic structure, an EMS unit causes muscle contractions similar to those obtained by exercise. The EMS units are specifically used to prevent atrophied muscles or for retraining muscles, such as in an individual who has been paralyzed or partially paralyzed. In addition, EMS is used for many other applications such as range of motion improvement, increased circulatory action and the prevention of blood clots. \n\nBoth types of therapies are convenient, in that they're used at home, and the patient controls the dose, generally by way of either a knob or a switch. Electrodes are user-replaceable, though placement instructions are given and monitored by a physician or physical therapist. TENS units also have a \"burst\" feature, enabling the patient intermittent increases, which is helpful after strenuous activity or if you're just having a bad day. I personally found that feature very helpful!\n\nA Yale University study entitled [Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for Skeletal Muscle Function](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375668/)(Yale J Biol Med. 2012) discussing electrical stimulation (ES), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES) states that the potential that electrical stimulation holds for rehabilitation recovery is immeasurable. It is used to improve muscle strength, increase range of motion, reduce edema, decrease atrophy, heal tissue, and decrease pain. \n\n>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), used interchangeably with electrical stimulation (ES), is typically provided at higher frequencies (20-50 Hz) expressly to produce muscle tetany and contraction that can be used for \u201cfunctional\u201d purposes and can be found in literature as early as 1964. TENS is an alternate form of electrical stimulation that historically used high frequencies for pain relief but is now also administered at very low frequencies (sensory level TENS, 2-10 Hz). *TENS propagates along smaller afferent sensory fibers specifically to override pain impulses.* When very low frequencies are used, TENS specifically targets sensory nerve fibers and does not activate motor fibers; therefore, no discernible muscle contraction is produced.\n\nThis source also has chapters on other subjects pertinent to your question, including, among others:\n\n- Parameters of electrical stimulation\n- Pulse width/duration\n- Stimulation pulse patterns\n- Stimulation intensity\n- Dosing of stimulation\n- Limitations of electrical stimulation.\n\nIn addition, you may also be interested in the following charts:\n\n- For EMS, [this](http://www.electrotherapy.org/assets/Downloads/NMES%20Muscle%20Stimulation%20march%202013.pdf) describes in detail which muscles are targeted by names, and at which frequencies.\n\n- [This](http://www.tensunits.com/chart.html)\nshows placement of electrodes of TENS unit, based on the location of the pain.\n\n \n<sub>For further information, including uses, cautions and case studies, see:</sub>   \n<sub>[Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/325107-overview#aw2aab6b40)</sub>  \n<sub>[Effects of Three Recovery Protocols on Range of Motion, Heart Rate, Rating of Perceived Exertion, and Blood Lactate in Baseball Pitchers During a Simulate Game.](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead0/Effects_of_Three_Recovery_Protocols_on_Range_of.97263.aspx)</sub>  \n<sub>[Serratus muscle stimulation effectively treats notalgia paresthetica caused by long thoracic nerve dysfunction: a case series](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2758879/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Understanding the Differences Between TENS and EMS Units](http://tensunitshop.com/understanding-the-differences-between-tens-and-ems-units/)</sub>    \n<sub>[How Does A Tens Unit Work?](http://www.tensunits.com/work.html)</sub>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "1142": "The simpler story is that it is better to eat whole fruit. \n\nThe problem with eating smoothies or even drinking fruit juice is that you are increasing the fruit's glycaemic index.

In 2001, a [National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis][nih] made the recommendation that calcium should be supplemented to maintain daily intake 1000 - 1500 mg/day in older adults. The reasoning behind this was that calcium is crucial for maintaining bone mass, which tends to deteriorate during the aging process, leaving this group at increased risk for fractures. The panel acknowledged that most older adults do not obtain this amount of calcium from their diet; they therefore suggested supplementation to this level. \n\n**Emerging Skepticism**<br>\nSince the NIH recommendation in 2001, several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have called into question the efficacy of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures. Although [total fracture risk appears to be marginally reduced][bt], the data suggested that hip fractures, which cause the most significant morbidity and mortality, [are not prevented with calcium supplementation][hbf].\n\n\n**Possible Risks**<br>\nIn addition to questions about efficacy, concerns have been raised about [possible increase in cardiovascular events][mb08] in those receiving calcium supplements, especially women.

It seemingly evolved in us for better utilization of TMPRSS2, as [Shirato et al. (2016)](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/1/e01387-16 ) report: \n\n> Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a causative agent of the common cold, enters host cells via two distinct pathways: one is mediated by cell surface proteases, particularly transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the other by endosomal cathepsin L. Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. **We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2.** Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin.\n>\n> IMPORTANCE: Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that **clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2.** Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.\n\nThe same authors have another (followup, or sorts) [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303914?via%3Dihub) on two other coronaviruses:\n\n>  Here, we show that clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 preferred the cell-surface TMRRSS2 to endosomal cathepsins for cell entry, similar to HCoV-229E. \n\nSomewhat similar [observations](https://jvi.asm.org/content/92/3/e01933-17) for NL63 (but these lack a historical/evolutionary perspective, since NL63 was only discovered in 2004.)\n\n> TMPRSS2 is important during early stages of the infection. It was previously suggested that coronaviruses may bypass the endocytic entry route employing transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which primes the fusion protein and enables fusion of viral and cellular membranes on the cell surface (28, 29). **We have tested whether inhibition of TMPRSS2 with camostat affects the HCoV-NL63 infection. We observed that inhibition of TMPRSS2 hampers virus infection in HAE cultures**, while it has no effect on virus replication in LLC-MK2 cells. No inhibition of virus entry was observed in any of the models, as tracked with confocal microscopy visualizing the nucleoprotein.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Recent reports on other coronaviruses (28, 29, 35) suggested that these viruses may bypass the endocytic entry route using TMPRRS2 as the priming protease, enabling entry directly from the cell surface. **Our experiments showed that inhibition of this protease indeed inhibited virus infection. Interestingly, it did not hamper virus internalization into the cell.** Our data are consistent with the data presented by others (28, 29, 35), yet we believe that there is a different mechanistic explanation for the observed phenomenon. We believe that TMPRRS2 indeed is required for the virus-cell fusion, acting similarly to cathepsins, but it does not enable fusion on the cell surface, and the acidification of the microenvironment is required.\n\n(HAE = \"cultured human airway epithelium\"; \"LLC-Mk2 cells (ATCC CCL-7; Macaca mulatta kidney epithelial)\" The [original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1024) on the discovery of NL63 noted that \"The *in vitro* host cell range of HCoV-NL63 is notable because it replicates on tertiary monkey kidney cells and the monkey kidney LLC-MK2 cell line.\")\n\nSo for NL63 too, TMPRSS2 is basically a \"catalyst\" for cell entry, but its absence while slowing down NL63 didn't quite stop it from entering human airway epithelium cell... but (if I'm reading it correctly) the paper found that despite the virus still being pulled into the cell (in the absence of TMPRSS2) it wasn't as effective/infectious...

But getting a cold does NOT protect you against future colds, largely for the same reasons that a vaccine is highly unlikely (read on...).\n\nThere are multiple barriers to creating a successful vaccine against the common cold. First, as you noted, what we call 'the common cold' is really a constellation of symptoms that can be caused by over 200 different organisms [1], most of them viruses (including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus) but also some bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and a couple others named ___ pneumoniae)[2]. A successful vaccine would need to protect against at least the most common ones (similar to the yearly flu vaccine which typically covers 3 strains of influenza) - a more difficult task than creating a vaccine for, say, polio (which only has 3 strains [3]). Second, the reason you have to get the flu shot every year is because the virus mutates. The same goes for cold viruses - they mutate, and rather frequently [1], meaning a new vaccine would need to be developed at least annually.\n\nAdditionally colds frankly just aren't a very high priority. While it is true that young babies, the very elderly, and those with certain health conditions can suffer serious complications from a cold, most of us just get an annoying cough & nasal symptoms for a few days.

Any double calorie diet at any other restaurant or at home could do the same. So, this experiment does not provide any convincing evidence to say that McD food is unhealthy. \n\nIn [another experiment][3], another guy was on a *hypocaloric diet* by eating carefully at McDonalds for 180 days - he lost 13.6 kg (30 pounds) and his cholesterol levels dropped significantly.\n\n**Is there any other evidence to say that fast food is unhealthy?**\n\nA typical food pattern in fast food restaurants includes hamburgers and sandwiches (white bread, processed beef or bacon, cheese), chicken nuggets and French fries (with fried oils), salad with dressing (oils), apple pies, chocolate cookies, ice cream and sweetened beverages (sugar) ([McD menu][4]). Such food pattern *tends* to:\n\n - have little fiber, so it can be **[constipating][5]**\n - be energy dense and can be, in association with lack of fiber, less satiating, which can make you eat more than you need and **[gain excessive weight][6]**\n - have a lot of quickly absorbed carbohydrates (plain starch in white bread and fries, sugar), which is, along with excessive weight, a risk factor for **[diabetes type 2][7]**\n - have an excessive amount of trans fats (in French fries, chicken nuggets, pies, biscuits - [USDA][8], [Foodwatch][9]), which can increase LDL cholesterol, which can be a risk factor for [**cardiovascular disease**][10]\n - contain a lot of preservatives and other food additives, which **spoil the taste**\n\nTo be fair, in many fast food restaurants, including McDs, you can also buy an apple, a salad without dressing, a veggie burger and mineral water.\n\n**Are sandwiches themselves considered the worst kinds of junk food and are the those from McD significantly worse than sandwiches in general?**\n\nSandwiches typically contain processed meat. *High* consumption of processed meat is associated with increased risk of **[cardiovascular disease and diabetes type 2][11]**. I don't have any evidence to say that sandwiches are the worst food and which brand is worse, though.\n\n**In conclusion,** there is evidence that *food patterns* (not the food items themselves) promoted by fast food restaurants are associated with increased health risks.

Ingestion of abnormally large amounts of fat at once could trigger diarrhea, though.\n\n**How do we know that most of fat is absorbed?**\n\nThere is a fecal fat test in which you are instructed to consume 100-150 g fat per day for few days and then the amount of fat in your stool is measured for few days.

For example, RDA for [calcium][4] for adults is 1,300 mg, but the maximal absorption occurs when you take less than  500 mg at once.\n\nSplitting the dose can be more important with prescribed supplements, which usually come in multiple RDA doses.

However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro,Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.\n\nMy conclusions from reading this abstract: it includes human study. It is not directed specifically to C. diff. It discusses recolonization of the gut microbiome and that recolonization might be necessary for probiotics to be effective for ulcerative colitis.\n\n", "18644": "Firstly energy/calories for this bar are itself high as is case with many energy bars.

It is not a new idea. It goes back to the early days of the last century and beyond. The counter-claim, that there is no relationship between diet and acne, has reached mythic proportions. It has never been substantiated, but it is repeated as gospel in all major dermatology textbooks. Epstein, commenting on contributions on the subject by Waisman, Bickers, and Rosenberg, trod the middle road. Inexplicably asserting that \"Controlled studies indicate that foods have no effect on acne,\" he nonetheless allowed, \"the patient should receive any assistance that dietary control may impart.\" **In a review of 274 clinical trials of acne, the massive 2001 Evidence Report on the Management of Acne found *one* solitary paper that mentioned diet, but no trial reported specifically on patients\u2019 diets.**\n\n> Dairy products have been implicated as a possible factor in the etiology of prostate cancer in several large epidemiological studies, but not in all.

Time alone will tell.\n\n> [F. William Danby: \"Acne and milk, the diet myth, and beyond\"][1], J AM ACAD DERMATOL FEBRUARY 2005\n\nWhile it seems very much up for debate to either substantiate whether indeed industrialised milk production schemes result in increased hormone presence in milk sold, whether there is a difference between production methods and 'ingredients' in milk sold, whether this is then true for all dairy products.\n\nCase in point: water soluble pharmacologically active compounds will be greatly reduced in butter and ghee, molecules found in whey greatly reduced in most cheeses, and anything greatly processed is another game entirely. If yeasts, worms, insects bacteria ferment the milk-product, how much of the hormones is reduced by those organisms? \u2013\u2013 or amplified?\n\nMilk as is not the main product consumed by most people and all dairy products are clearly not the same. Kefir is different from cheese, fresh or aged, with bacteria or fungi, from whey, from butter, from ghee, from protein-isolate and so on. Given the different profiles for all those products they either have to have something in common across the board or they have to be analysed separately.\n\nIt is of course quite interesting to look for evidence that shows how much different modern milk and milk products are compared to just a few decades ago. Be it in nutritional or now even pharmacological profiles. \n\nBut to start a comparison with dairy, hypothesising about hormones, then linking that all up to skin disorders seems very premature and theoretical. At least if there are not clear epidemiological indicators of indeed a possible link.\n\nWhich suspects would there be to observe in the proposed link between acne and skin?\n\nOnly the most prominent are:\n\n> Prolactin, Somatostatin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, Luteinizing hormone, Thyroid-stimulating hormone, Thyreotropin-releasing hormone, Epidermal growth factor, Insulin-like growth factor 1, Insulin-like growth factor 2, Insulin, Vitamin D, Transferrin, Lactoferrin, Prostaglandins\n\nNow which of these are contained in fresh milk under which circumstances and therefore concentrations in the first place? How much of this is linked to milking pregnant cows?\n\n\n> **Acne and milk**     \nMilk and other dairy products contain more than 60 molecules including prolactin, somatostatin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating and thyreotropin-releasing hormones, insulin, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, IGF-1 and 2, transforming growth factors, vitamin D, transferrin, lactoferrin and prostaglandins (Koldovsky, 1995).  **This makes it difficult to distinguish which of these factors could have an acneigenic effect, especially when this fact is combined with the broad range of dairy products** (Table 25.2, Figure 25.4).     \n The most important factor of the ones mentioned above is the insulin-like growth factor.  The IGFs are proteins with high sequence similarity to insulin. IGFs are part of a complex system that cells use to communicate with their physiologic environment. **Cow milk contains IGF-1 and -2, even after pasteurization and homogenization, and bovine and human IGF-1 share exactly the same amino acid sequence** (Melnik and Schmitz, 2009). High milk consumption increases IGF-1 levels 10%-20% in adults and 20%-30% in children (Hoppe et al., 2004 a, b) and milk and dairy products raise IGF-1 levels more than dietary proteins such as meat (Hoppe et al., 2005).     \nMilk also contains carbohydrates, including lactose, and therefore its consumption produces a glycemic response and an insulinemic response.  The insulinemic response to ingested milk is actually three to six times what would be predicted from the carbohydrate load in the milk serving (Ostman et al., 2001).  **This happens for skimmed and full-fat milk, but not for cheese** (Holt et al., 1997; Hoyt et al., 2005).  **The reasons are not yet understood, but they may** relate to the insulinotropic effects of some of the other multiple hormones that are present in milk (Koldovsky, 1995).\nA glass of milk added to a low glycemic index meal can boost the insulin response up to 300% of the level produced by a high glycemic index meal and cow milk-formula does this even better than human breast milk (Liljeberg and Bjorck, 2001; Lucas et al., 1980). **Different studies suggest that insulin rises in response to the whey component** (20% of milk protein), **whereas casein is responsible for the IGF-1 increase** (Hoppe et al., 2006). Because whey and casein are both involved in stimulating androgen production, there is little point in further differentiating them in dietary restriction, since both should be avoided.\n\n\nIf the result of the above is indeed true: \"whey and casein should both be avoided\" then this is still incomplete as to whether it is for example whey-protein itself (essentialist reading) or what's commonly in there (varying by methods of production) as well and surely  not encompassing 'all dairy', as butter for example is largely free of both.\n\nThen it remains a stretch to conclude that \"stimulating androgen production\" is just \"all bad/causes acne\" on the one side and on the other side there are other types of causes that are \"stimulating androgen production\": hyperinsulinemia for example, which can also activate or upregulate IGF receptors. \n\nIt is simply too simplistic to reduce the focus to just one or a few pathways and \"reason the rest\" from there.\n\nBut take note that this is not the sole point of that article. The very next item was about 'glycemic index'. To give more context:\n\n> Key facts\n\n> -   Androgen excess, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and inflammation are the main pathogenetic mechanisms of acne.\n-   Nutrition seems to play an important role in skin biology and pathology, affecting the onset and clinical manifestation of several dermatologic disorders, including acne.\n-   The typical Western diet consists of numerous dairy sources and foods with high glycemic indices.\n-   A study performed by Adebamowo et al. (2005) demonstrated the association between dairy products and acne.\n-   A study provided by Smith et al. (2007) showed the link between high glycemic load intake of carbohydrates and acne.\n-   High glycemic carbohydrates and milk appear to raise serum insulin levels, free IGF-1 and insulin resistance, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of acne.\n-   IGF-1 seems to be the most important acneigenic factor contained in diet.\n-   At the genomic level, the effects of insulin and IGF-1 are mediated by the nuclear concentration of the transcription factor FoxO1.\n-   At the promoter level, SREBP-1c expression is suppressed by nuclear FoxO1, which is an important co-repressor of the retinoid X receptor and liver X receptor.\n-   Dermatologists should be able to include dietary restriction in acne therapy management.\n \n\n\n> Summary points\n\n> -  Skin reflects individual age, health and beauty.\n-  Nutritional customs affect several skin diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and acne.   \n- Epidemiological studies with milk and dairy products support the association of milk consumption with acne\nonset and clinical course.\n-  High glycemic load diets are also considered to be involved in acne pathogenesis because of the consequent\nhyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.\n-  Dermatologists should include restrictive dietary management in acne therapy in their daily clinical practice. \n\n\n> A.I.

The dairy side sponsoring research to show how \"good it is for you\", and from animal-rights over vegan to frankenfood-companies financing the other side of ideology. All sides looking for evidence that they *were* right, from the start. This is more like gnosis that science and it is extremely difficult to weed out all the chaff thrown in to the pool of knowledge.\n\n\n> A meta-analysis can help inform the debate about the epidemiological evidence on dairy intake and development of acne. A systematic literature search of PubMed from inception to 11 December 2017 was performed to estimate the association of dairy intake and acne in children, adolescents, and young adults in observational studies. We estimated the pooled random effects odds ratio (OR) (95% CI), heterogeneity (I2-statistics, Q-statistics), and publication bias. We included 14 studies (n = 78,529; 23,046 acne-cases/55,483 controls) aged 7\u201330 years. ORs for acne were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.15\u20131.36; p = 6.13 \u00d7 10\u22128) for any dairy, 1.22 (1.08\u20131.38; p = 1.62 \u00d7 10\u22123) for full-fat dairy, 1.28 (1.13\u20131.44; p = 8.23 \u00d7 10\u22125) for any milk, 1.22 (1.06\u20131.41; p = 6.66 \u00d7 10\u22123) for whole milk, 1.32 (1.16\u20131.52; p = 4.33 \u00d7 10\u22125) for low-fat/skim milk, 1.22 (1.00\u20131.50; p = 5.21 \u00d7 10\u22122) for cheese, and 1.36 (1.05\u20131.77; p = 2.21 \u00d7 10\u22122) for yogurt compared to no intake. ORs per frequency of any milk intake were 1.24 (0.95\u20131.62) by 2\u20136 glasses per week, 1.41 (1.05\u20131.90) by 1 glass per day, and 1.43 (1.09\u20131.88) by \u22652 glasses per day compared to intake less than weekly. Adjusted results were attenuated and compared unadjusted. There was publication bias (p = 4.71 \u00d7 10\u22123), and heterogeneity in the meta-analyses were explained by dairy and study characteristics. In conclusion, any dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, was associated with an increased OR for acne in individuals aged 7\u201330 years. \n\n> ***However, results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity and bias across studies.*** \n\n> Christian R.

However, studies to date have failed to reveal changes in the eccrine sweat glands or blockages of sweat ducts following iontophoresis (Hill, Baker, & Jansen, 1981; Holze & Ruzicka, 1986), and thus fail to support these hypothesized mechanisms.\n\nThe proposed mechanism of action in this article is:\n\n> I propose that iontophoresis works via the production of a colloid formed between the products of dark (mucin) and clear (aqueous solution) cells, and the jamming of nanomineral particles inside the lumen and/or the duct of the sweat gland, creating a blockage that temporarily prevents further sweat production or secretion.\n\nOlder references on the mechanism of action:\n\n- Reinauer S, Schauf G, Hubert M, H\u00f6lzle E (1992): [Mechanism of action of tap water iontophoresis: Functional disturbance of the secretory epithelium](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296945185_Mechanism_of_action_of_tap_water_iontophoresis_Functional_disturbance_of_the_secretory_epithelium)\n- Hill AC, Baker GF, Jansen GT (1981): [Mechanism of action of iontophoresis in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7261675)\n\n------------\n\nIn terms of side effects e.g. effects on skin barrier function, there is some related work on saline iontophoresis:\n\n- Singh J, Gross M, Sage B, Davis HT, Maibach HI (2000): [Effect of saline iontophoresis on skin barrier function and cutaneous irritation in four ethnic groups.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10908819)", "18159": "\n**1.

Entrapment frequently results from ankle sprains or twisting of the ankle, as this causes the nerve to stretch in the lower leg.\n>\n> Another cause of nerve entrapment occurs at the point where the nerve exits the deep fascia of the leg, the nerve becoming compressed by this fascia. Surgical decompression of the nerve therefore is used to provide relief from the symptoms and pain.\n>\n> ### Direct Damage to the Superficial Fibular Nerve\n>\n> The superficial fibular nerve may be damaged by fracture of the fibula, or by a perforating wound to the lateral side of the leg.\n>\n> As the muscles that the superficial fibular nerve innervates are evertors, injury to the nerve may result in a loss of eversion. A loss of sensation over the majority of the dorsum of the foot and the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg could also result.\n\nScienceDirect provides summary pages with excerpts from relevant publications on many topics, including the [fibularis muscles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/fibularis-muscles), which largely verifies the claims from the anatomy teaching site. I'll include two especially useful excerpts here.\n\n> [**Chapter 32 - Leg Injuries.

Tinel's sign over the site of the compression or pain with passive ankle flexion/supination may be elicited. Pressure over the site of entrapment while the patient actively plantarflexes and inverts the ankle may reproduce symptoms. A fascial defect may be detected on palpation.\n>\n> ### Treatment\n>\n> Initial conservative treatment may include modification of aggravating activities and prevention of recurrent ankle inversions using bracing. Surgical decompression is the definitive treatment.\n>\n> [**Chapter 19 - Compression and entrapment neuropathies. Bouche. *Handbook of Clinical Neurology*. 2013.**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444529022000199)\n>\n> ### Superficial Fibular Neuropathy\n>\n> Superficial fibular nerve compression or entrapment is unusual. Peroneal compartment syndrome is an uncommon disorder in which the muscle swelling and necrosis are limited to the fibular muscles. It can be due to excessive exercise, blunt trauma, or rupture of the peroneus longus. Fracture of the fibula may damage only the superficial fibular nerve...Causes were varied: muscle herniation, varicose veins, anterior and/or lateral compartment syndrome, anterior fasciotomy, or contusion. There was decreased sensation and pain over the dorsum of the foot at rest or during exercise. Reduced nerve conduction velocity of the superficial fibular nerve below 44 m/s was considered abnormal.\n\nYou'll notice that these articles make little mention of motor defects, including your hypothesized \"constant supination of the foot,\" like those motor deficiencies that occur with comparable [brachial plexus injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus_injury). This is because the eversion action of the muscles supplied by the superficial fibular nerve is supplemented by muscles innervated by the deep (profundus) fibular nerve (whereas brachial plexus injuries \"knock out\" entire muscle groups that work in opposition to a still-active group). \n\nWith superficial fibular nerve pathologies, the supinating action of the muscles supplied by n. fibularis profundus isn't so strongly unopposed that a remarkable club foot presentation appears, but long-term superficial peroneal nerve dysfunction still limits function in the lower leg and can be treated non-invasively:\n\n> [**Evaluation and treatment of peroneal neuropathy. Baima & Krivickas. *Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med*. 2008.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684217/)\n>\n> If the patient has isolated superficial peroneal nerve palsy, he may benefit from a shoe insert with a lateral wedge to prevent supination of the foot from weakness of the evertors.\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/46TYb.jpg", "17900": "Psychology is an important component of the human sexual response.  Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety spectrum disorders can significantly change an individual's sexual response.  Sexual dysfunction such as anorgasmia (difficulty achieving orgasm), decreased libido (lower sex drive), lower arousal state, and erectile dysfunction (difficulty achieving or maintaining full erection) are a common symptom reported in individuals with depression and other mental health conditions.\n\nFurthermore, many medications (especially those that alter neurophysiology) also have the potential to interfere with the sexual response.  Not all that take these medications have the same sexual side effects, but there are medications with higher rates of sexual side effects than others.\n\nMost individuals who experience SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction see improvement either through switching to a different medication, or via psychotherapy (focused on sexual response) and \"retraining the response.\"  There are infrequent but existing cases of persistent SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, such as in [this study by Csoka et al][1], where they cite \n\n> \"mechanistic hypotheses including persistent endocrine and epigenetic\n> gene expression alterations.\"\n\nThis is less clear in lithium, as there are far fewer studies.  A paper in 2015 titled [\"Lithium and sexual dysfunction: an under-researched area\"][2] explored the literature and found it lacking in robust studies on the topic.  They emphasize that \n\n> \"Sexual dysfunction during lithium treatment appears significantly\n> associated with a lower level of overall functioning and may reduce\n> compliance\"\n\nwhich is why this topic is certainly an important issue to address, as [maintenance therapy is a critical component of supporting mental health stability][3] - especially for those struggling with disorders that involve mania and/or psychoses.\n\nTreatment of lithium and other medication-induced sexual dysfunction can certainly be successful, but may require effort and different modes of therapy - for which both medications and sexual psychotherapy exist.  I hesitate to get into the specifics, as it would be of greatest benefit for an individual struggling with this to discuss his/her specific situation with the prescribing physician, and also possibly a psychologist.\n\n*This is what my initial review has yielded.

It should be easy, on the face of it. Only that this pathogen is widespread and comparatively mild, making other venues seemingly more pressing. But there were attempts, illustrating some problems along the way:\n\n> Toxoplasmosis, caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, is widespread throughout the world. The disease is of major medical and veterinary importance, being a cause of congenital disease and abortion in humans and domestic animals. In addition, recently it has gained importance owing to toxoplasma encephalitis in AIDS patients. In the last few years, there has been considerable progress towards the development of a vaccine for toxoplasmosis, and a vaccine based on the live-attenuated S48 strain was developed for veterinary uses. However, this vaccine is expensive, causes side effects and has a short shelf life. Furthermore, **this vaccine may revert to a pathogenic strain and, therefore, is not suitable for human use.** Various experimental studies have shown that it may be possible to develop a vaccine against human toxoplasmosis. Recent progress in knowledge of the protective immune response generated by T. gondii and the current status of development of a vaccine for toxoplasmosis are highlighted.\n\n> [Kur J, Holec-Gasior L, Hiszczy\u0144ska-Sawicka E.: \"Current status of toxoplasmosis vaccine development.\", Expert Rev Vaccines. 2009 Jun;8(6):791-808][1]. doi: 10.1586/erv.09.27.\n\nEven if relatively mild, introducing pathogenic elements is unethical. And may not sell that well?\n\n\nAmong the reasons for the difficulties encountered were:\n> - Lack of efficacious protective antigen candidates\n- Lack of detailed understanding of pathogenic, immune and host cell invasion mechanisms\n- Insufficient advanced research techniques and theories of immunology or vaccinology\n- Can DNA vaccines fulfill their promise?\n- Biosafety of DNA vaccines\n- Immune tolerance and allergy problems of DNA vaccines\n- The efficacy of DNA vaccines\n>\n> [Qi Liu, Lachhman Das Singla, and Huaiyu Zhou: \"Vaccines against Toxoplasma gondii: Status, challenges and future directions\", Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2012 Sep 1; 8(9): 1305\u20131308.][2] doi:  10.4161/hv.21006\n\nResearch is not standing still on this front. Especially DNS vaccines seem to have made some progress:\n\n> Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects all warm-blooded animals including humans and causes toxoplasmosis. An effective vaccine could be an ideal choice for preventing and controlling toxoplasmosis. T. gondii Superoxide dismutase (TgSOD) might participate in affecting the intracellular growth of both bradyzoite and tachyzoite forms. In the present study, the TgSOD gene was used to construct a DNA vaccine (pEGFP-SOD).\n>\n> The present study revealed that the DNA vaccine triggered strong humoral and cellular immune responses, and aroused partial protective immunity against acute T. gondii infection in BALB/c mice. The collective data suggests the SOD may be a potential vaccine candidate for further development.\n\n> [Yuan Liu et al.: \"Immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding Toxoplasma gondii Superoxide dismutase (TgSOD) induces partial immune protection against acute toxoplasmosis in BALB/c mice\", BMC Infect Dis. 2017; 17: 403.\nPublished online 2017 Jun 7.][3] doi:  10.1186/s12879-017-2507-5\n\nThese are promising but still quite preliminary. Whether looking at live or live-attenuated vaccines, protein vaccines, DNS vaccines, epitope vaccines, carbohydrate vaccines, exosome vaccines, RNA vaccines or possible adjuvants, a big bunch of ideas is considered, developed and tested for. Only that they really lack a base of attack.\n\nOne of the latest reviews in the field summarises it:\n\n> Despite continuous research efforts, there are still very few effective strategies against toxoplasmosis. In the past few years, numerous vaccination experiments have been performed to control T. gondii infection.\n\n>  In this review, the authors summarize the development of T. gondii vaccines with proper adjuvants, ranging from live or live-attenuated vaccines to protein vaccines, DNA vaccines, epitope vaccines and novel vaccines. They also highlight the challenges involved in the development of T. gondii vaccines, including specific impediments and shortcomings.\n\n> Expert opinion: Moving towards the development of effective vaccines against T. gondii is not only a tedious mission but also a difficult challenge. Future studies should consider new approaches and strategies for vaccine development, particularly novel vaccines and genetic adjuvants, as well as optimizing immunization protocols and evaluation criteria.\n\n> [Yawen Li & Huaiyu Zhou: \"Moving towards improved vaccines for Toxoplasma gondii\", Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy,  Volume 18, 2018 - Issue 3,][4] https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2018.1413086\n\nThe unsound base from which most of this research is fishing in the dark is that neither the life cycle nor the actual most of invasion/infection are fully understood. Not in the least because there are quite a few strains in the wild, some much more pathogenic than others.\n\nThe last cited review opinion closes with:\n> In our view, directions for future research should focus on the development of an effective cat vaccine. Such a vaccine would prevent oocyst shedding by cats and reduce oocyst contamination of the environment and risk to animals and humans. The priority is to develop a live-attenuated vaccine using non-reverting mutants. With the wide use of CRISPR technology, generating gene deletion mutants as live vaccines has become feasible and provides a novel approach for the control of toxoplasmosis. Therefore, it is expected that several years will be required before an effective vaccine against T. gondii is ready and available.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19485758\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579912/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5463464/\n  [4]: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14712598.2018.1413086", "17397": "According to a case report about a 24-year old woman ([PubMed Central][1]), in **agoraphobia,** during a panic attack, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which results in adrenaline release, which causes symptoms, such as:\n\n> ...pounding heart, shortness of breath nervousness, dizziness, losing\n> control on himself **for few minutes.**\n\nSo, from symptoms lasting few minutes, you can conclude that adrenaline is acting for few minutes and not all the time.\n\nAccording to one [2005 study][2], **caffeine** stimulates adrenaline release, but\n\n> **adrenaline alone does not account for the effects of caffeine** and\n> additional mechanisms must be involved.\n\nFrom the above, one might think that caffeine could help you stay alert despite already being stimulated by adrenaline from anxiety.\n\nBut, according to one [2015 review article][3]:\n\n> moderate-to-high consumers develop tolerance to caffeine and **only low\n> or nonconsumers can eventually benefit from an acute administration.**\n\n**In conclusion,** one who drinks a lot of coffee on a daily basis, will probably develop tolerance to caffeine, in which case the wakening effect would be a placebo effect.\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361850/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464218/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462044/", "16853": "The linked [article's][1] title and subtitle are in contradiction with the article's content.\n\nThe title and subtitle say:\n\n> THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY WHEN YOU HOLD IN A FART...If you\n> keep one inside too long, it can bubble up to your mouth instead...\n\nBut the text says:\n\n> ...gas literally bubbling up from your intestines and coming out as a\n> burp...That\u2019s because, at this point in the digestive process, the gas\n> is still much closer to your mouth than your anus.\n\nThe gas discussed above is the gas in the first part of the small intestine (just after the stomach).

In psychology, this generalized way of thinking is called \u201cover-generalizing.\u201d Another distressing error in reasoning is \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d: If something disturbing happens, people immediately draw exaggerated conclusions about the scope of the supposed disaster ahead.\n\nSuch thought patterns can sometimes develop into self-fulfilling prophecies and make life difficult for the people affected. Cognitive therapy helps people learn to replace these thought patterns with more realistic and less harmful thoughts. It also helps people to think more clearly and to control their own thoughts better.\n\n**How does behavioral therapy work?**\n\nBehavioral therapy assumes that human behavior is learned and can therefore be unlearned or relearned and aims to find out whether certain behavioral patterns make your life difficult or intensify your problems. In the second step you work on changing these behavioral habits.\n\nFor example, people who have developed depressive thoughts often tend to withdraw and give up their hobbies. As a result, they feel even more unhappy and isolated. Cognitive therapy helps to identify this mechanism and find ways to become more active again.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy focuses on current problems and finding solutions for them. It is much more concerned with dealing with current problems. The most important thing is helping people to help themselves: They should be able to cope with their lives again without therapy as soon as possible. This does not mean that cognitive behavioral therapy completely ignores the influence of past events. But it mainly deals with identifying and changing current distressing thought and behavioral patterns.\n\nAs an example, in anxiety disorders, behavioral therapy often includes learning methods to help you calm down. For example, you can learn to reduce anxiety by consciously breathing in and out deeply so that your body and breathing can relax. When doing this you concentrate on your breathing instead of what is bringing on your anxiety. These kinds of techniques can help you to calm down instead of getting all worked up with anxiety.\n\n**When is cognitive behavioral therapy an option?**\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders, and addictions.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy requires the patient's commitment and own initiative. Therapy can only be successful if the patient actively takes part in the treatment and also works on their problems between sessions. This can be a considerable challenge, especially with severe conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders. That is why medication is sometimes used at first to quickly relieve the worst symptoms so that psychotherapy can be started.\n\nChoosing a certain kind of psychotherapy also depends on the goals. If you feel the need for deep insight into the causes of your problems, cognitive behavioral therapy is probably not the right choice. It is particularly useful if you are mainly interested in tackling specific problems and are only secondarily concerned with the \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\n**How long does it take?**\n\nIt is important that you and your psychotherapist have a close and trusting working relationship. It can sometimes take a while to find the right therapist.\n\nIn the first session, you will briefly explain your current problems and outline your expectations. That forms the basis for discussing the goals of therapy and the therapy plan. The plan can be adjusted if your personal goals change over the course of therapy.\n\nTherapy often includes recording your own thoughts in a journal over a certain period of time. The therapist will then check the following things with you: Do I perceive things appropriately and realistically? What happens if I behave differently than I normally do in a certain situation? You will regularly discuss any problems you may have and progress that you have made.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy also uses relaxation exercises, stress and pain relief methods, and certain problem-solving strategies.\n\nSome people already feel much better after a few sessions, while others need treatment for several months. This depends on the kind and severity of the problems, among other things. An individual session lasts about an hour. Sessions usually take place once a week. Cognitive behavioral therapy is offered in psychotherapy practices, hospitals and rehabilitation clinics- sometimes also offered as group therapy.\n\n**Can cognitive behavioral therapy also have side effects?**\n\nSide effects resulting from psychotherapy cannot be ruled out. Being directly confronted with your problems or anxieties may be very stressful at first, and relationships might also suffer as a result. It is crucial to speak openly with your psychotherapist if any difficulties come up during therapy.\n\n> 'We saw that a third of people had a difficult memory resurface, had\n> more anxiety, or felt stressed.

We are not alone. Recent studies imply that sun exposure does more than simply make vitamin D and that one cannot fully replace the benefits of sun exposure by simply taking a vitamin D supplement.][1]\n\nThere are differences. Differences between sunlight synthesised and supplemented. But also between those two types compared to D derived from food.\n\nJust one example: Sunlight D remains twice as long in the blood compared to ingested D:\n> [**Vitamin D: The \u201csunshine\u201d vitamin** (2012)][2]<br>\n> **Sources of vitamin D**\n>\n> A major source of vitamin D for most humans is synthesized from the exposure of the skin to sunlight typically between 1000 h and 1500 h in the spring, summer, and fall. **Vitamin D produced in the skin may last at least twice as long in the blood compared with ingested vitamin D.** When an adult wearing a bathing suit is exposed to one minimal erythemal dose of UV radiation (a slight pinkness to the skin 24 h after exposure), the amount of vitamin D produced is equivalent to ingesting between 10,000 and 25,000 IU. A variety of factors reduce the skin's production of vitamin D3, including increased skin pigmentation, aging, and the topical application of a sunscreen. An alteration in the zenith angle of the sun caused by a change in latitude, season of the year, or time of day dramatically influences the skin's production of vitamin D3.\n\nFurther, producing D uses up cholesterol and sulfate, since D is found in more forms in the human body than just those D1-3 compounds:\n\n> [**Determination of four sulfated vitamin D compounds in human biological fluids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. (2016)**][3]<br>\nThe determination of both the water-soluble and lipid-soluble vitamin D compounds in human biological fluids is necessary to illuminate potentially significant biochemical mechanisms. The lack of analytical methods to quantify the water-soluble forms precludes studies on their role and biological functions; currently available liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods are able to determine only a single sulfated form of Vitamin D. We describe here a highly sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of four sulfated forms of vitamin D: vitamins D2- and D3-sulfate (D2-S and D3-S) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2- and D3-sulfate (25(OH)D2-S and 25(OH)D3-S). A comparative evaluation showed that the ionization efficiencies of underivatized forms in negative ion mode electrospray ionisation (ESI) are superior to those of the derivatized (using 4-phenyl-l,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD)) forms in positive ion mode ESI. Separation was optimised to minimise co-elution with endogenous matrix compounds, thereby reducing ion suppression/enhancement effects. Isotopically labelled analogues of each compound were used as internal standards to correct for ion suppression/enhancement effects. The method was validated and then applied for the analysis of breastmilk and human serum. The detection limits, repeatability standard deviations, and recoveries ranged from 0.20 to 0.28fmol, 2.8 to 10.2%, and 81.1 to 102%, respectively.\n\n  \n[Different forms][4] have different [actions][5] and even if all forms might be transformed from D3 alone that requires enzymes whose efficiency is not necessarily equally adequate across the whole population or whose inter-actions involves competing pathways. Supplements usually contain only one single form.\n\nBut since skin colour, clothing habits or necessities, and latitude make it almost impossible for many people to get enough sun exposure there is just no other way but too increase the D level by ingesting *some* form to reach amounts  needed or amounts considered 'optimal' or beneficial.\n\nAs can be seen from the second link: <br>\nsunlight > D-containig food > supplements\n\n[Sunlight][6] (as always: in [moderation][7]) has other beneficial effects beyond D, but even as food might not provide  enough D, supplements *then* are still very probably a [worthwhile option][8].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/vitamin-d-supplementation-and-sun-exposure-can-we-pick-and-choose/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26708628\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173203\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045457\n  [6]: http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng34/resources/sunlight-exposure-risks-and-benefits-1837392363205\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323044\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299734", "14679": "One of the low-fat diet risks include poor brain function, because the brain basically requires a high amount of cholesterol, which can be reduced by low levels of healthy fats in the ration.

Given the wide usage of cinnamon in the food industry, the notion that this popular food additive, instead of a drug, may activate thermogenesis, could ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against obesity that are much better adhered to by participants.\n\n# Inconclusive Results \n\nBut trying to gain a systematic view on such a complex substance is quite a challenge.\nThe Cochrane Library  concludes in [Cinnamon for diabetes mellitus][7]:\n\n> There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type\n> 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further trials, which address the\n> issues of allocation concealment and blinding, are now required. The\n> inclusion of other important endpoints, such as health-related quality\n> of life, diabetes complications and costs, is also needed.\n\nAnother 2011 Research Summary:\n> One fairly well-studied supplement used to help hyperglycemia in diabetics is cassia cinnamon. Animal and laboratory studies have indicated that cinnamon may mimic the effects of insulin and make cells more sensitive to insulin (Anderson et al., 2004).\n> In diabetic patients, some studies have shown a favorable response; some no effect. The most comprehensive review of cinnamon use in diabetics, published in 2008 by the journal Diabetes Care (Baker et al., 2008), found no metabolic benefits to the use of cinnamon by type I or type II diabetics. Specifically, no benefits to fasting blood glucose, lipids, or cholesterol were observed in a meta-analysis of five small clinical trials.[ \\[Ronald Ross Watson and Victor R. Preedy: \"Bioactive Food As Dietary Interventions For Diabetes\", Academic Press: San Diego, London, 2013][9],  p377.]\n\nWhereas an article in Annals of Family Medicine sees it in more positive light:\n\n[Cinnamon use in type 2 diabetes: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.][8]\n\n> The consumption of cinnamon is associated with a statistically\n> significant decrease in levels of fasting plasma glucose, total\n> cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels, and an increase in HDL-C\n> levels; however, no significant effect on hemoglobin A1c was found.\n> The high degree of heterogeneity may limit the ability to apply these\n> results to patient care, because the preferred dose and duration of\n> therapy are unclear.\n\n\n# Summary\n\nPlease note that most of the positive results where obtained in beakers and rats, while studies of its effect in humans are mostly either negative, not replicated or inconclusive. Citing a single study that is not a fundamental and large breakthrough is usually a good indication that the newspapers have filled their bogus pipeline.\n\n\nThe effect on metabolic rate seems to be out of focus for the interest in cinnamon and its most promising fields of application as a medicine are directed to diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Whether those sources cited by the OP have *any* background in valid and reliable scientific evidence seems unlikely. More likely is that they are all examples of 'journalism' (this is meant as an insult) and bad science communication: Taking preliminary findings and blowing them out of proportion, misrepresenting the facts given to them.\n\n\nCinnamon in moderation as a spice is nice. If used as an agreeable herb that makes fibrous ingredients more attractive without adding much calories it is superb. If taken as a medicine or supplement it can be quite ineffective and at the same time dangerous. This is especially true if one does not differentiate between cinnamon and cassia. If using large amounts of cinnamon might still be a goal then there are some more things to consider:\n\n[How much cinnamon is too much?][10]\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon#Traditional_medicine\n  [2]: https://nccih.nih.gov/health/cinnamon\n  [3]: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ppar/2008/581348/abs/\n  [4]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089990071200144X\n  [5]: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/193229681000400324\n  [6]: https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0026-0495(17)30212-3\n  [7]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007170.pub2/full\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24019277\n  [9]: http://Ronald%20Ross%20Watson%20and%20Victor%20R.%20Preedy: \"Bioactive Food As Dietary Interventions For Diabetes\"\n  [10]: https://health.stackexchange.com/q/508/11231", "14055": "You can look up practically any medicine that exists and you will find long lists of all of the possible side effects, risks and interactions.\n\nManufacturers have to list everything that could possibly go wrong, in order to cover their butts legally, in this \"*Caution: Coffee May Be Hot!*\" world that we live in.

As far as I understand this it is about comparing [near death experiences][1] and [sleep paralysis][2]. (Commonly, I would regard in this context \"clinical death\" as real death. A really final stage of life from where there is no coming back by definition \u2013 and for example Jesus is not recorded to have said much about *this* experience afterwards. Other instances of people 'coming back' seem even less trustworthy anecdotes.)\n\n# What is near death experience (NDE)?\n\n> According to the NDE-scale a near-death-experience includes a few, or\n> several, of the following 16 elements:\n> \n> - Time speeds up or slows down.\n> - Thought-processes speed up.\n> - A return of scenes from the past.\n> - A sudden insight, or understanding.\n> - A feeling of peace or pleasantness.\n> - A feeling of happiness, or joy.\n> - A sense of harmony or unity with the universe.\n> - Confrontation with a brilliant light.\n> - The senses feel more vivid.\n> - An awareness of things going on elsewhere, as if by extrasensory perception (ESP).\n> - Experiencing scenes from the future.\n> - A feeling of being separated from the body.\n> - Experiencing a different, unearthly world.\n> - Encountering a mystical being or presence, or hearing an unidentifiable voice.\n> - Seeing deceased or religious spirits.\n> - Coming to a border, or point of no return.\n\nJoy, peace and happiness seem to be in direct contradiction with what is commonly said about sleep paralysis: \n\n# What is sleep paralysis (SP)?\n\n> [Sleep paralysis is a relatively common but under-researched phenomenon. While the causes are unknown, a number of studies have investigated potential risk factors.][3] [\u2026]\n> Sleep paralysis involves a period of time at either sleep onset or upon awakening from sleep during which voluntary muscle movements are inhibited. Ocular and respiratory movements remain unaltered and perception of the immediate environment is clear. These episodes are frequently associated with a variety of hallucinations, such as a sense of an evil presence (known as intruder hallucinations), pressure felt on the chest (incubus hallucinations), and illusory feelings of movement (vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations). Sleep paralysis is a global phenomenon, with terms for sleep paralysis existing in over 100 cultures. In many places, sleep paralysis experiences are interwoven with a culture\u2019s folklore. Episodes of sleep paralysis have been suggested as an explanation for supposed paranormal phenomena such as witchcraft, demonic assault, and space alien abduction. Fear and distress are typically associated with episodes, though feelings of bliss are sometimes reported.\n\nThat seems to be a much complicated issue: near universal neurological and psychological experiences are reported with wildly differing language. It is debatable how much of this is cultural influence of what is talked about afterwards or cultural difference of what is actually experienced.\n\nBut the one thing in common for NDE and SP is the so called out-of-body experience.\n\n> [Sleep Paralysis, \"The Ghostly Bedroom Intruder\" and Out-of-Body Experiences: The Role of Mirror Neurons.][4]\n> This interaction involves a convergence of inputs in the right SPL, and their target zones in V5. Not surprisingly, damage to the prefrontal cortex sometimes results in echopraxia \u2014 i.e., miming what somebody near is doing. Analogously, the massive deafferentation of sensory input during SP would lead to a similar disinhibition of the MNS and its propensity to project its body into another individual \u2014 if you are a chimp \u2014 or another virtual body, if you are a human. A disturbance of these interactions would lead to the more florid manifestations of an alien abductor, bedroom intruder, or mysterious other \u2014 seen so frequently during SP. In addition, we suggest that OBEs during SP, likewise result from the massive deafferentation that occurs during REM sleep paralysis. These ideas could be explored using neuroimaging, to examine the selective activation of brain regions associated with mirror neuron activity, when the individual is hallucinating an intruder or having an OBE during SP.\n\nThe overlap for this is sometimes striking:\n\n> Other noteworthy influence factors are certain circumstances that arise during operations.  These include so-called anaesthesia awareness. Patients do not feel any pain, but for a short time \u2014 seconds or minutes \u2014 they are in fact awake.  This short time feels to them as if it were an eternity. So after the operation, they can tell astonished clinical staff about details of the operation, such as what the surgeons were talking about. If in addition out-of-body experiences are induced by medication, we can picture to ourselves how a patient might talk about this afterwards: he might well say that he had come out of his body and observed what was going on in the operating room.  Theoretically, in such a situation, the out-of-body experience could also be explained by saying that the anaesthetic did not work completely, so that the patient was awake but did not feel his own body. This is an association which resembles sleep paralysis. Such anaesthesia awareness is a relatively frequent phenomenon, occurring in one out of every 1,000 cases of narcosis. Worse are conditions in which the experience of pain is not completely switched off. This happens in three out of every 10,000 narcoses. Consider a typical hospital in the German city of Leipzig with 1,700 patient beds and 43,000 patients annually. Statistically, 320 operations are conducted every week! Now we can much better imagine how often such things occur. The chances of experiencing anaesthesia awareness are rather high.  Thus, iatrogenic near-death experiences are highly probable in patients who undergo an operation.<(1), p 99.>\n\n\n\n\nThere are certainly beliefs out there, that draw a direct connection:\n> The Night-mare, Traditional Hmong Culture, and Sudden Death (Sudden Death and the Night-mare: Is There a Connection?)\n> Thanks to the many Hmong men and women with whom I spoke, the logic of the Hmong explanation for the role of *dab tsog* in the sudden nocturnal deaths was now clear to me.\nAlthough it was its resonance with the night-mare that first drew me to the topic of SUNDS, part of me wished that there was no connection\u2014that the syn- drome could be attributed to causes entirely recognizable within the biomedical model and that would not, through a cultural vector, provide yet another opportunity for some to view the Hmong immigrants as exotic and alien. The traumatic recent history of the Hmong refugees (that led to their resettling in the United States) soon revealed a biocultural connection that was previously obscured by historical and geographical distance. I will now turn to this relationship to show how Hmong explanations of lethal *dab tsog* attacks can simultaneously be understood from a biomedical perspective.  <(3) p 94\u2013116.> \n\nThat last citation is followed with \"The Night-mare and the Nocebo \u2013 **Beliefs That Harm**\" (emphasis added).\n\n# Summary\n\nThere is an overlap in the descriptions of both phenomena, but this is rather small. This suggests that they are not the same but seem to share certain pathways on the biological level and certain expectations on the cultural level. It is unlikely that someone who is \"just\" having a sleep paralysis really dies from that alone \u2013 it is nevertheless a distressful experience that might amplify underlying conditions \u2013 and if nocebo adds to that this might not be entirely harmless.  Fortunately, sleep paralysis seems to be a lot more treatable than death.\n\n\n\n- References\n\n1.

These spaces are occupied by air, fluid or the extremities of odontoblasts, cells that produced the dentin, which are at the periphery of the pulp chamber, the center of the tooth. The nerves in the middle of the tooth are only capable of transmitting information about pain and are unable to discriminate between the various causes.\n\nOne of the most accepted theories to explain dentine sensitivity was [the hydromechanical theory by Dr. Martin Bra\u0308nnstro\u0308m][1]. The pain is caused by the movement of fluid in the tubules due to changes in temperature and pressure. Pressure on the tooth or a hot stimulus cause the fluid to expand inwards and compress the odontoblasts and nerves in the middle of the tooth. Prolonged drying or a cold stimulus causes the water in the tubules to contract outwards (toward the stimulus), which causes a suction of the odontoblasts into the tubules which in turn pull on the nerves in the middle of the tooth, again causing discomfort or pain.\n\nLastly, over-the-counter analgesics (painkillers) will not be very effective at preventing the pain, and more powerful ones will only mask the pain temporarily. Use of special toothpaste to block the tubules and desensitise the nerves can work, but an examination by an oral health professional will make sure that there is truly no other factors at play. \n\n\n\nMy sources, other than professional training:\n\n[Brannstrom, M.

Early mobility has been shown for many years to be a major predictor of postoperative outcome, even in something like a hip fracture, where you would think rest was mandatory. The rapidity with which one returns to preoperative levels of independence in activities of daily living decreases postoperative morbidity and optimizes psychological well-being.\n\nComplications of \"resting\" \n\nPostoperative pulmonary complications, specifically atelectasis and pneumonia, are the leading cause of postoperative morbidity and death. Confinement to bed is a very serious risk factor for atelectasis and pneumonia. After surgery - especially upper abdominal surgery - sufficiently deep breathing needed to prevent some degree of pulmonary compromise is painful. If you're up and moving, you will (voluntarily and involuntarily) be taking more and deeper breaths than you will at rest (characterized by shallower respirations), especially if you're on pain medications.\n\nVenous stasis and thromboembolism commonly occur postoperatively in patients who remain immobile. This is largely preventable with simple ambulation. It hurts to walk around after surgery, to be sure, but it's a lot better than suffering from a largely preventable pulmonary embolism.\n\n>All efforts should be made to enforce postoperative movement, which is possible with adequate pain relief.\n\nLoss of strength\n\nBedrest results in loss of muscle mass and progressively more weakness. While it's not as great a consideration in younger adults as older adults, it is still considerable and, again, is largely preventable. Moving improves strength recovery, appetite, decreases stress, and overall increases feelings of well-being.\n\nPain Medications\n\nOpioid medications usually given perioperatively can slow your bowels to almost a stand still (it's called *ileus*) and can result in painful gas buildup and constipation. Moving, and to a lesser extent dietary changes, encourage the bowels to be less sluggish, as does a switch to non-opioid pain medications.\n\nWhy \"rest\"? \n\nMost people think healing is impaired by early movement after surgery. While this is true of some surgeries, it is far from true for all of them. When the risk of resting outweighs the benefits, the goal is to get patients moving.\n\n[Atelectasis](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atelectasis/basics/definition/con-20034847)  \n[Postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956305800044)  \n[Management of patients in fast track surgery](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119685/)", "4541": "So there are a few things making this a difficult question to answer.  Much of the in-depth research hasn't been done on healthy individuals (biomechanics of the foot), but where there's something wrong (pathomechanics of the foot).  There is also a difference between what is theoretically best ([found here][1]) and what people actually do ([sort of found here][2]).  Also, the search terms might not be readily apparent because the biomechanical word for \"standing\" is \"stance\" (eg \"load distribution in stance\").\n\n\nThe best models and papers I found were also behind pay walls (which my institution has access to), but I can summarize the information as follows:\n\nThere are 6 main points of pressure in the healthy foot: the heel, and the head of each (5) [metatarsals][3]:\n\n[![Image of load points of the foot.][4]][4]\n\nThe metatarsal head of the hallux (big toe, labeled 2 above) should take about 2x the pressure as the other 4 heads, which roughly balances the left to right load on the foot.\n\nAs far as front to back, the only reference I found that calculated an ideal position was the one I [mentioned before][1], and seemed to indicate the heel should receive 52.6% +/- 1.36% of the load of the foot (Fig 7).  Presumably the rest of the weight would then be distributed to the metatarsal heads as mentioned above.\n\nI will say that was calculated with math I don't quite understand, and on a very idealized adult foot.  It might be much more useful to ask the question: \"How do people with healthy feet and gates distribute the load on their feet?\"\n\nThat would go back to my [second reference][2] and give us this lovely figure: [Fig 1]\n\n[![Load of adult and children taken at stance][5]][5]\n\n\nMy final conclusion is that if you are concerned about your gate you should see an OT or PT. Check for uneven wear on the feet, and try to stay \"balanced.\"\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3818677\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173105/\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus\n  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/K7erA.png\n  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dag9K.jpg", "4293": "Most of the recommendations that I see on the internet are in the 1g-1.5g per kg of bodyweight, not per pound. However, there is no real specific \"You must eat this\" number for protein that is correct for everyone. \n\nThe [basic recommendation currently in the US][1] is 56g per day for the average sedentary man or woman, based on a 70kg body weight. As you exercise, that requirement goes up. However, based on your own age, body makeup, type of activity, it will vary some. \n\n[This study compared][2] leucine and nitrogen balance in both sedentary and strength athletes, using a range from .8 to 1.8 (rounded) g/kg of protein, and tested the nitrogen balance. The low end of the scale was sufficient for sedentary, while the mid-high levels were sufficient for strength athletes.\n\n[This study on endurance athletes][3] suggests that for low-moderate training levels, the sedentary protein consumption was adequate, *provided* that carbohydrate levels were high enough. For high training levels, then higher protein intake was indicated.\n\nFor the long term, many of the problems that can occur may or may not be related to the protein, but also to the excess fats and the quality of the protein. Here is a [good writeup on a review of self reported problems][4] in an Atkins type diet (High protein/fat, low carb).\n\nAt 160g/day, you are at a level that I would consider sufficient for around a 220 lb man that is actively engaged in strength training (You do say you are bulking).

No conclusions can be drawn for the long-term effects. \n\nAnd second, this kind of study is also not really feasible. A lot of people go through a short or even medium term period of delayed sleep or even sleep deprivation in their lives. Think of, for example, students studying for exams not sleeping enough for a week or two. Patients receiving medication with the side effect of insomnia. Parents not sleeping enough for weeks, months, or even years. Teenagers partying late for several days in a row. \n\nGetting a control group for such a study would be hard to impossible - I'd go as far as suggesting that by the time someone is 40 or 50 years old (so that we could compare long-term effects), almost nobody would even qualify as a control group subject who had never experienced sleep deprivation or delayed sleep for more than two days or so. \n\nThere are long-term effects of long working hours (12 hours is long) and shift work, but that is really another question and six days is unlikely to cause any of them. \n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2082105/\n  [2]: http://m.oem.bmj.com/content/58/11/747.short\n  [3]: http://m.pnas.org/content/111/6/E682", "4202": "Lowered brain activity in a PET scan isn't necessarily bad. It depends on what *part* of the brain is less active than usually and whether this is a *permanent* or *transient* state. Our brains are less active during sleep - that isn't a bad thing. \n\nAnyway, brain activity isn't just generally lowered during meditation. On the contrary. \n\n[Functional brain mapping of the relaxation response and meditation][1] found (emphasis mine):\n\n> Significant (p <10\u22127) **signal increases** were observed in the group-averaged data in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, hippocampus/parahippocampus, temporal lobe, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and pre- and post-central gyri during meditation. Global fMRI signal decreases were also noted, although these were probably secondary to cardiorespiratory changes that often accompany meditation. The results indicate that the practice of meditation **activates** neural structures involved in attention and control of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n[Long-term meditators self-induce high-amplitude gamma synchrony during mental practice.][2]\n\n> In addition, the ratio of gamma-band activity (25-42 Hz) to slow oscillatory activity (4-13 Hz) is initially higher in the resting baseline before meditation for the practitioners than the controls over medial frontoparietal electrodes. This difference increases sharply during meditation over most of the scalp electrodes and remains higher than the initial baseline in the postmeditation baseline. \n\nBasically, it's a lot more complicated than meditation decreasing brain activity. \n\nAs for recreational drugs, I am not sure where you got a generally decreased activity from, but for example long-term use of meth [decreases the amount of dopamine receptors in the brain][3]. Dopamine is important for feelings of pleasure and reward and building memories. \n\n> Studies in methamphetamine abusers have also documented significant loss of DA transporters (used as markers of the DA terminal) that are associated with slower motor function and decreased memory.

When this portion of the heart contracts, this is what pushed blood out through the arteries to deliver oxygen to various systems (organs, muscles, skin, etc.) This surge is what you feel when you articulate a pulse.\n\nHowever, Yes it is possible in a surgical intervention which has been pointed out. There are LVAD's (Left Ventricular Assist Device) which will produce a pulseless human. When reading up on it, I did find an interesting study that suggests [LVAD use may stimulate heart regeneration][1].\n\n  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109714075822", "1546": "This [article][1] should give an idea of the likelihood of pregnancy based on the number of sperm available. If you look at the graph of the Probability of Conception vs. the Sperm Concentration, it shows that at more than 10 million sperm/mL (or around 30-40 million total sperm, estimating average semen volume to be 3-4 mL), the probability of conception per month quickly reaches a plateau, while at under this concentration there is a roughly linear drop in the probability of conception to zero at zero sperm. [Another study][2] shows a high variability in the number of sperm present in pre-ejaculate. Of the 28 men tested, only 12 produced any detectable sperm in their pre-ejaculate at all. Of these 12, the sample with the highest number of sperm contained 35 million (subject 17). If this man consistently produced this many sperm in his pre-ejaculate, I would estimate the probability of him causing conception per month as 35 million divided by 35 million (from above) multiplied by ten percent, i.e., 10%/month.\n\nIn other words, it is possible, according to these studies, for pre-ejaculate to cause pregnancy. However, this evidence also suggests that some men, if their lack of sperm in pre-ejaculate is consistent, may be unable to cause pregnancy in this way.\n\n  [1]: http://www.metrovanurology.com/content/semen-analysis#Predicting%20the%20Probability%20of%20Pregnancy%20Using%20the%20Semen%20%20Analysis\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564677/", "44": "The [short answer][1] is that Type 1 diabetes is an [autoimmune disease][2], a disease that is caused by the body's own immune system attacking and destroying insulin-producing cells, called [beta cells][3] (which are located in the [islets of Langerhans][4]).<sup>1</sup>\n\nWhat, exactly, kicks off this autoimmune response [is as yet unclear][5].

With your skin, it's actually better if you use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.\n\nEczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin. The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called *ceramide*. Others believe it's an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids). \n\nWhatever the case may be, moisturizers do provide a barrier of some type to the skin and help to decrease transepidermal water loss; therefore they are highly recommended for AD. Not using moisturizer will leave you open to more problematic eczema. Your skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. You should use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema.\n\nOther things which help Atopic Dermatitis involve water temperature when bathing (the cooler, the better), patting your skin dry instead of vigorous rubbing, applying the moisturizer immediately after bathing when your skin has already been moistened by the water, getting a reasonable amount of sun on affected areas, avoiding wool and heavy clothing that might make you sweat, using \"gentle\" soaps (only soaping up areas that need cleaning), showering briefly twice a day instead of once (applying moisturizer afterwards!) etc.\n\nThere are some new ceramide-based moisturizers that have been shown to be helpful in AD. Some are very expensive while others are more reasonably priced. Some dermatologists have recommended *TriCeram*. You can spot test it (one arm or one affected area) to save money while evaluating how well it works for you.\n\nDetermining what kinds of moisturizers work best for you involves trial and error, but whatever works, from petrolatum or Aquaphor, coconut oil (frectionated coconut oil and Johoba oil absorb into the skin a bit better so are less greasy), or another type, don't be hesitant to use it.

It also comes into play during the spring time change for those who live where DST is observed as well as in the shift from weekend/holiday to weekday sleep patterns for many.\n\nBegin by thinking of your body\u2019s circadian pattern on an X,Y graph<sup>1</sup> where:\n\n`x`= time   \n`y`= activity   \n![graph][1]\n\nYour goal (\u201cphase advance\u201d) is to shift this curve leftward by three hours along the `x` axis. \n\nWhen attempting to manipulate circadian phase, the key is to understand your body\u2019s [Zeitgebers].Your body intrinsically has circadian oscillators that confer the cycle and determine the period; Zeitgebers are external agents that *entrain* this oscillation by maintaining or shifting it along the `x` axis. The most powerful Zeitgeber, hands down, is **light**.\n\nNow the question is: what is the relationship between light and this curve? That turns out to be slightly complex in that the answer depends on the time in the circadian cycle during which the stimulus is applied. The relationship has been very well worked out in some [very cool experimental protocols][cac]. Here it is:<sup>2</sup>\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\nYour goal is to achieve `y= +3` (which corresponds to `\u0394= -3` along the `x` axis on the first graph). You can see here that an optimal light stimulus perfectly timed is able to achieve almost a 3-hour shift in a single cycle. The optimal stimulus is going to be bright light in the blue frequency range, and the optimal timing is going to be about 2 hours before your habitual wake time. (About 45 min duration is probably just as good as a longer duration.) \n\nPractically, a good tip is: for two days prior to leaving, set your alarm an hour early and expose yourself to bright light (either broad-spectrum sunlight or blue light from a lightbox) for 30-45 min immediately upon waking. Each day\u2019s exposure can be expected to achieve a 1-1.5 hour phase advance, and this protocol can be remarkably effective for mitigating the jet lag on the following day when you need to get up 3 hours prior to your habitual wake time.\n\n[The other answer][oa] mentioned melatonin. Administered exogenously, this is indeed another Zeitgeber, although much less powerful than light. Melatonin also has a phase response curve that turns out to be basically 180&#186; shifted relative to the light PRC. That is, if the optimal timing for light to phase advance is around 2 hours prior to the habitual wake time, the optimal timing for melatonin administration will be 12 hours prior to that. For most people that corresponds to  4-6 hours prior to their habitual bedtime.\n\nEating and exercise are both fairly weak Zeitgebers, and I wouldn\u2019t worry about them too much. As usual in circadian biology, **it\u2019s all about light!**<sup>3</sup> \n\n-----\n<sub>\n1.

Melatonin or light administered at the wrong time does the exact opposite. Although a three-hour phase shift is fairly easy to manage by predicting the phase of the PRC based on prior sleep habits, this starts to become more complicated in larger shifts. This is especially problematic in the case of Eastward travel >5h, when morning light at the destination ends up falling within the *negative* phase of the PRC and therefore *delays* the circadian curve. This is the **wrong thing** in this setting and is a common reason for protracted jet lag. Here, it is actually avoidance of morning light that is desired.

The GM foods are very complex and currently there is a lack of evidence-based research with regard to medium/long-effects on health and it remains as a matter of great public concern. Further research is required on how best to carry the experiments (modern profiling techniques and define the 'normal' compositions of conventional plants), risk assessments and surveillance studies with respect to GM crops and foods.\n\nThe Royal Society in their [2002 report][27] saying there is at present no evidence that GM foods cause allergic reactions, use of\nspecific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible and conclude that consumption poses no significant risk to human health, and that ingestion of GM DNA has no effect.\n\nStudy from [2003 by J Toxicol Environ Health][28] summarise it:\n\n> The review of available literature indicates that the genetically modified crops available in the market that are intended for human consumption are generally safe; their consumption is not associated with serious health problems. However, because of potential for exposure of a large segment of human population to genetically modified foods, more research is needed to ensure that the genetically modified foods are safe for human consumption.\n\nCurrently the broad scientific consensus states that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food<sup>[2010][29], [2011][30], [2012][31]</sup>.\n\n\n----------\nFurther readings:\n\n- Wikipedia\n - [Genetically modified food][32] (GM food)\n - [Genetically modified crops][33] (GMOs, biotech crops, transgenic plants)\n - [Genetically modified organism][34] (GMO)\n - [Genetically modified food controversies][35]\n - [Genetic engineering][36] ([Transgenesis][37], [Cisgenesis][38], Subgenic)\n - [Plant breeding: Genetic modification][39]\n - [Detection of genetically modified organisms][40]\n - [GM organisms in agriculture][41]:\n\n   - [GM soybean][42] (controversies: safety),\n   - [GM tomato][43],\n   - [GM wheat][44] (controversies: safety, ecological, intellectual property law, contamination of the non-GM, etc.),\n   - [GM rice][45] (controversies: safety, should be labeled, intellectual property, contamination of the non-GM, etc.)\n   - [GM alfalfa][46] (and legal issues in the UK),\n      > Growers can spray fields of Roundup Ready alfalfa with the glyphosate herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the alfalfa crop.\n   - [AquAdvantage salmon][47] (trade name for GM Atlantic salmon)\n\n     Concerns: survival, rate of growth, smoltification, allergenicity, muscle fibers, lack of fertilization, swimming capabilities, decreased sperm velocity\n\n    - [GM canola][48]\n    - [GM maize][49] (Effects on nontarget insects, Gene flow, corn recalls)\n\n- [The Truth about Genetically Modified Food][50] at Scientific American\n- [Are You Eating Frankenfood?][51] article by Martin Teitel, Ph.D.\nand Kimberly A.

The\npossible explanations include preservation in a frozen state,\npreservation in an animal reservoir, or retention in an\nintegrated, as yet undetected form in the genetic material of\na human or lower animal. The animal reservoir option is\nunlikely, for the accumulation of mutations would have\ncontinued. There is no evidence for integration of influenza\ngenetic material into the host genome, leaving the most\nlikely explanation that in 1977 the H1N1 virus was reintroduced\nto humans from a frozen source.\n\nAccording to a [2009 (academic) blog](https://www.virology.ws/2009/03/02/origin-of-current-influenza-h1n1-virus/) the actual lab/source of the release was never found and the Chinese and Russians/Soviets strongly denied it came from one of their labs:\n\n> This possibility has been denied by Chinese and Russian scientists, but remains to this day the only scientifically plausible explanation.\n", "23167": "The answer is yes, there are \"general features\" of\nthe immune system and basically of our genome that combat many different pathogens, but also there are very specialized ones, only useful against a few. To make the matter more complicated, recent research has found that the immune system \"cross-learns\" from infections (and possibly from vaccines as well).\n\nFirst on \"purely genetic\" defences, some alleles confer enhanced resistance to some viruses. Quoting a [2007 review](https://doi.org/10.1038/nri2174)\n\n> Some proteins that are required for\nsurviving viral infection are used to combat many other\nmicroorganisms as well. In mammals, for example, myeloid\ndifferentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88), a\nToll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule, is required for\neffective resistance to herpesviruses, Toxoplasma gondii\nand other organisms that have few obvious features in\ncommon. By contrast, some defences that evolved recently\nare matched against specific microorganisms and may\noperate only within a single host species. For example, the\nLy49H receptor expressed by mouse natural killer (NK)\ncells seems to recognize only mouse cytomegalovirus\n(MCMV), and does so only in some strains of mice, as the\nreceptor-encoding gene has been deleted in other strains.\nMore tentative defences are also apparent. For example,\n**mutational abrogation of the human CC-chemokine\nreceptor 5 ([CCR5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5)) protein offers strong protection against\ninfection with HIV, but the most common protective allele\nhas not been driven to fixation in humans.** And it is likely\nthat many other potential resistance mechanisms remain\nto be exploited in mammals.\n\n> Some protective antiviral systems are cell autonomous,\nwhereas others depend on multiple specialized cell types\nthat interact both with the infected cells within the host\nand also with one another. In mammals, the response to\nviral infection overlaps substantially with the response\nto bacteria, using some of the same sensing, signalling and\neffector mechanisms. In insects, there is a greater reliance\non cell-autonomous defence, and new advances must be\nmade in defining the pathways that are involved. [...]\n\n> Resistance to viral infection comes at a definite cost.\nIn mammals, the cellular systems that confer protection\nagainst viruses are also capable of causing autoimmunity. This may be seen as a reflection of three facts. First, viruses\nhave imposed a need to distinguish between host nucleic\nacid and foreign nucleic acid \u2014 a challenge that has been\nmet by mammals in the large part, but not completely.\nSecond, viruses certainly contributed to the evolution of\nadaptive immunity, upon which autoimmunity is predicated.\nAnd third, some of the elements of innate immunity\nthat support autoimmune disease (among them the\n|IFNs and cells that produce them) evolved largely to\ncombat viruses.\n\nBeyond this \"fixed\"/innate defense system, there's another more [recently discovered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087274/) one that can be considered \"intermediate\" (i.e. between innate and the classical def of \"adaptive immunity\"):\n\n> Protection against reinfection has been reported not only in plants and invertebrates that do not have adaptive immunity (4), but also in mammals, with old and **new studies demonstrating cross-protection between infections with different pathogens** (5). These studies have led to the hypothesis that innate immunity can be influenced by previous encounters with pathogens or their products, and this property has been termed *trained immunity* or *innate immune memory*.\n\n(In fact this discovery has led some to [propose](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01964547/file/Pradeu-DuPasquier_Immunological%20memory_Online%20version.pdf) a reconsideration of the immune system dichotomy.)\n\nAlso, you assume (in your #2) that COVID-19 outcomes are always better with more immune response, but that [might not actually be the case](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01056-7) (harking back to a hypothesis about the 1918 flu deadliness):\n\n> Some of the earliest analyses of coronavirus patients in China suggested that it might not be only the virus that ravages the lungs and kills; rather, an overactive immune response might also make people severely ill or cause death. Some people who were critically ill with COVID-19 had high blood levels of proteins called cytokines, some of which can ramp up immune responses. [...]\n\n> A combination of damage from both a virus and the immune response to it is not uncommon, says Rafi Ahmed, a viral immunologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The effects of 'hit-and-run' viruses such as norovirus, which make people sick almost immediately after infection, are more probably due to the virus itself, he says. By contrast, people infected with viruses such as coronavirus do not show symptoms until several days after infection. By then, collateral damage from the immune response often contributes to the illness.\n\nBased on the convergence of epidemiological data and animal research, the auto-immune response is [suspected](https://www.nature.com/articles/445267a) to have been a (probably more significant) factor in 1918:\n\n> unlike contemporary influenza strains, which typically affect the very young and the elderly most severely, the 1918 influenza pandemic was mostly fatal in young adults, who generally possess more robust immune systems.\n\n> The work of Kobasa et al. substantiates the findings of Kash et al., who showed in mice that the 1918 virus triggered a vigorous innate immune response that was linked to fatalities. Although the mechanisms of tissue destruction were not addressed in either study, the work clearly demonstrates the vital function of early innate immune defences in controlling the virus. It seems that the pandemic 1918 virus had a genetic composition and rapid replication kinetics that may have resulted in an excessively vigorous innate immune and inflammatory response that contributed to severe tissue damage, disease and death.\n", "22856": "Yes, they can, see e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905159 (field of cheminformatics) re the possiblity of drug discovery in general via machine learning.

Eliminating all suspected foods until symptoms improve and then introducing them back one by one is a reasonable method.\n - Even if you can control symptoms of GERD by lifestyle changes, GERD won't likely heal on its own until the *underlying causes* (obesity, hiatal hernia, delayed gastric emptying) persist.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nCauses and risk factors of GERD\n-\n\n**1) Insufficiency of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES),** a muscular valve that normally prevents reflux of food and acid from the stomach into the esophagus due to ([Mayo Clinic][1]):\n\n - Obesity, pregnancy\n - [Fructose malabsorption][2]\n - Hiatal hernia - a slip of the upper part of the stomach through an opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm muscle\n - [Bile reflux][3] due to peptic ulcer or gallbladder removal\n - Increased gastric acid secretion can be associated with reflux, but, in most cases, this is not the cause ([GI Motility online, 2006][4])\n\n**2) Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis),** which can result from ([WebMD][5]):\n\n - A damage of the nerves due to [diabetes mellitus][6], Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.\n - Hypothyroidism\n - Drugs, like narcotics and antidepressants\n - Abnormal esophageal motility ([achalasia][7], [esophageal spasms][8])\n - Connective tissue diseases, such as scleroderma\n\nTriggers of GERD\n-\n\nIn a person with established GERD, certain triggers can aggravate reflux:\n\n - Certain foods and large meals\n - Lying down shortly after a meal\n - Medications: aspirin, antihistamines, narcotics (morphine, codeine, etc.), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, doxepin...), calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem...), clonidine, drugs to treat Parkinson's disease, lithium and progesterone ([MedicineNet][9]).\n - Smoking (nicotine)\n\nNOTE: Acidic foods may increase the feeling of esophageal irritation, but they don't actually increase the reflux:\n\n> ...some beverages with high acidity did not induce symptoms (i.e.,\n> prune juice) and others with low acidity did (i.e., tomato juice)\n> indicating other factors may play a role (18).

Furthermore, available evidence suggests that\n> controlled weight loss (by diet or surgery) is able to induce a\n> significant improvement in GERD symptoms and/or in GERD\n> clinical-endoscopic manifestations.

The following lifestyle changes have been supported by some studies:\n\n - Avoiding foods that are fatty (fried foods, chocolate), spicy or acidic (citrus fruits), carbonated beverages, sugars, tomato-based products, alcohol, caffeine (coffee, tea, cola), large meals and eating <2 hours before bed ([Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, 2019][12], [Journal of Thoracic Disease, 2019][13])\n - Weight loss, tobacco smoking cessation and head of the bed elevation ([Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 2017][14])\n\n**2) Medications and surgery** \n\nMedications that reduce the stomach acid (antacids, H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors) can prevent symptoms and damage of the esophagus; hiatal hernia and certain other conditions may require surgery ([American Family Physician, 2005][15]).\n\nTreatment of eventual *H. pylori* infection may improve or worsen GERD ([GI Motility online, 2006][4]).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940\n  [2]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03186.x\n  [3]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bile-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20370115\n  [4]: https://www.nature.com/gimo/contents/pt1/full/gimo21.html\n  [5]: https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-disorders-gastroparesis#1\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356931/\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216628/\n  [8]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-spasms/symptoms-causes/syc-20372250\n  [9]: https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm#what_are_the_symptoms_of_uncomplicated_gerd\n  [10]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20361959\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668774/\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6326208/\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702398/\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636482/\n  [15]: https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0615/p2376.html\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481226/", "20929": "In short, [balnotherapy][1] (bathing and exercising in mineral water)\n\ndoes not likely:\n\n - provide essential minerals through dermal absorption\n - improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, other rheumatic conditions, osteoarthritis or fibromyalgia better than hydrotherapy (immersing in plain water)... \n\n...but may help in dealing with stress associated with rheumatic conditions.\n\nIn certain European countries with a lot of natural spas, it's a habit that a doctor prescribes balnotherapy to a rheumatic or orthopedic patient as a form of physiotherapy; it's meant more as a stress relief than actual cure.    \n\n\nCan minerals be absorbed through the skin?\n-\n\nI did this research about dermal absorption of minerals once and the only thing I found is a small study in which they observed that bathing in **Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate)** was associated with increased blood magnesium levels ([epsomsaltcouncil.org][2]).\n\nAccording to a review in [Nutrients, 2017][3] other forms of magnesium, such as magnesium chloride, are not likely absorbed through the skin.\n\nI haven't found any evidence that any other essential mineral would be absorbed through the skin in meaningful amounts.\n\nDoes balnotherapy has any beneficial health effects?\n-\n\n**Rheumatoid arthritis**\n\n[Balneotherapy (or spa therapy) for rheumatoid arthritis.

It\n> is the most common form of dermatitis.\n\n**[Pathophysiology][2]**\n\n> The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis is complex and\n> multifactorial, involving elements of barrier dysfunction, alterations\n> in cell mediated immune responses, IgE mediated hypersensitivity, and\n> environmental factors. Loss of function mutations in filaggrin have\n> been implicated in severe atopic dermatitis due to a potential\n> increase in trans-epidermal water loss, pH alterations, and\n> dehydration. Other genetic changes have also been identified which may\n> alter the skin's barrier function, resulting in an atopic dermatitis\n> phenotype.\n\nThe causes of eczema are multifactorial,  it relate to a breakdown in the barrier function of the skin, dehydration and an associated immune response and inflammation.

The major preformed mediator histamine produces a\n> prototypic, short-lived urticaria. However, the clinical spectrum and\n> pattern of lesions indicate that other molecules, including\n> prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and chemokines, produced at\n> different times after mast cell activation contribute to the\n> polymorphism of this symptom and the variable evolution of this\n> disease.\n\nThe Pathophysiology link goes into some detail about the different forms of urticaria, both immunological (e.g. allergy, infection, vaccination) and non-immunologcial (e.g. aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\n\nThe underlying issue is release of inflammatory mediators from [mast cells][7]. Histamine is one of the most common of these molecules, which is why [antihistamine][8] drugs are an effective treatment for urticaria.\n\n***\n\nIn summary, eczema is localised to the skin, whereas urticaria represents the cutaneous manifestation of a more systemic process.\n\n***\n\n**Sources**:\n\n[dermnetnz.org][9]\n\n[Pathophysiology of Eczema][2]\n\n[Pathophysiology of Urticaria][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/atopic-dermatitis/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29063428/\n  [3]: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/emollients/\n  [4]: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/topical-steroids/\n  [5]: https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/urticaria-an-overview/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16461989/\n  [7]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell\n  [8]: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antihistamines/\n  [9]: https://www.dermnetnz.org", "20312": "[This study][1] answers that question.

I've inserted my research on this answer below. I'm very interested to hear what you think.\n\n------------\nNicotine is a component of cigarette smoke. Nicotine promotes angiogenesis in the laboratory (1), including in human retinal endothelial cells.(2) However, surprisingly \u201ccigarette smoke\u201d inhibits angiogenesis in the laboratory(3) and epidemiological studies suggest smoking is actually protective against developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy.(4) \n\nPyrazine compounds have been shown to be highly potent inhibitors of angiogenesis and the growth of chorioallantoic membranes (CAM). CAM are vascular membrane found in eggs of birds and reptiles which is analogous to the mammalian placenta.(5, 6)\n\nTobacco leaf contains very low levels of pyrazines and contains the precursors for pyrazine formation. After the tobacco leaf is roasted, the levels of pyrazines increases dramatically whilst the levels of amino acids in the leaf simultaneously decrease.(7) Pyrazines comprise a very small fraction of cigarette smoke condensate by weight (5-50\u00b5g/cig).(7) \n\nInternal documents obtained through litigation reveals cigarette manufacturers have added a range of non-nicotine compounds initially referred to as known as \u201cSuper-juice\u201d to cigarettes since approximately 1976.(8) Manufacturers have disclosed that Pyrazine compounds are currently 10 of out of the 599 ingredients in cigarettes. These compounds provided users who smoke \u201clight\u201d cigarettes with the flavor profile of high-tar cigarettes. Pyrazines were may enhance the perceived smoothness of the cigarettes, increasing the tolerability of irritation to the respiratory tract during consumption. Furthermore, pyrazine compounds were may have complex chemosensory effects which appeared to influence the \u2018learned behavior\u2019 of consumers, promoting and enhancing consumer acceptance and ongoing usage.(8) \n\nTo date, 106 pyrazines are found in either tobacco or tobacco smoke, with 40% of these pyrazine being found in both.(7) \n\nThe effect of nicotine and pyrazine on endothelial growth and survival has been compared, confirming that nicotine acts as a growth factor for endothelial cells and pyrazine acts as a death factor for endothelial cells. The following compounds were found to inhibit the growth of endothelial cells: 2-ethylpyridine, 3-ethylpyridine, and pyrazine.(9) \n\nOne component of cigarette smoke 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine (also known as ligustrazine, used in Chinese herbal medicine), has undergone a pharmacokinetic evaluation.(10) It  found that tetramethylpyrazine is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa into the systemic circulation, and then crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to reach the cerebral cortex.\n\nIn 2005, a group accidentally discovered that various compounds with a pyrazine-pyridine backbone are potent inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2).(11)\n\nThus, in isolation nicotine promotes angiogenesis of retinal endothelial cells partially via the VEGF pathway. However, cigarette smoke contains not only nicotine but also pyrazine compounds which antagonize VEGF receptors, potently inhibiting the angiogenic drive of nicotine.\n\n[![Graphic representatin of the Maillard Browning reaction in the formation of pyrazines][1]][1]\n\n\n \nReferences\n\n1.\t[Ma X, Jia Y, Zu S, et al. alpha5 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediates nicotine-induced HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression in non-small cell lung cancer.

This is from a perspective in the USA, but I believe that much of this applies globally.  (But please feel free to add answers from other countries, as I'd love to hear how things work elsewhere!)\n\nGuidelines (see also hierarchy of evidence [here][1] or [here][2] or [here][3]) are generally not rigid rules, they are consensus best-practice recommendations from a professional organization, based on evidence as it emerges.  Guidelines are excellent tools for decision-making because they provide a consensus of what many experts in the field have assessed that the current evidence from all available studies best supports.  \n\nBut Guidelines take a while to form and a while to revise or overturn, so they aren't necessarily reflecting cutting edge research.  Additionally, there are sometimes even conflicting guidelines from different organizations on a topic - for example frequency of mammogram (yearly vs every 2 years) is currently a hot debate between the major organizations that address women's health, with valid viewpoints on all sides (balancing frequency of rapidly progressing cases vs the harms of false positive rates and complications of unnecessary biopsies etc etc, which is a huge discussion on its own).\n\nThere is no single organization that issues guidelines for all physicians. There are professional organizations for each specialty and even subspecialty (like [AAFP][4] [ACOG][5] [AAP][6] [ACP][7] etc), professional organizations for major disease processes (like [American Cancer Society][8]), national organizations that look at how guidelines apply at a population level ([USPSTF][9], NIH), and independent organizations that provide EBM (evidence based medicine) tools for a fee that try to unite all recommendations and provide a discussion of how to approach decision making (UpToDate, Dynamed, and to a degree Medscape or Epocrates, etc).\n\nWhen a new guideline comes out that creates a paradigm shift, how does a doctor decide whether to follow it for an individual patient in his/her practice?  When guidelines contradict, which does he/she choose to use?  When a new study comes out that challenges current guidelines, does he/she change his/her practice based on the study, or wait until the professional organizations have digested it and weighed it against the current evidence, and issued new guidelines?\n\nThere is no single answer to those questions.  Physicians are trained to interpret and evaluate the strength and applicability of evidence, from guidelines to individual journal articles.  If there is a standard of practice, and the physician chooses to deviate, there very well may be good justification for that.  \n\nFor an over-simplified example, if a physician who has been practicing a long time has had success in treating patients with the old paradigm, and the new paradigm is controversial, or the new paradigm was only non-inferior without clear mortality or morbidity benefit, they might choose to stick with what they have seen work.  Medicine is called an art for a reason.\n\nThis is an interesting article that might help expand understanding of physician decision-making: https://www.elsevier.com/connect/why-arent-all-physicians-using-clinical-practice-guidelines.  \n\nThis article shows how the AAFP processed and recommended approaching the new ACC/AHA guidelines, to give another view into the complexity: https://www.aafp.org/afp/2018/0315/p372.html\n\n\nSo, what about LDL guidelines?  It's a little bit controversial.  I would say most newer physicians are going by the new guidelines, as that is what they learned while training.  But a discussion about how to decide whether or not to follow those new guideline is not a short, concise answer.  If I find a good article on it I will add it here.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_evidence\n  [2]: https://libguides.ohsu.edu/c.php?g=693307&p=4912291\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2981887/\n  [4]: https://www.aafp.org/patient-care/browse/type.tag-clinical-practice-guidelines.html\n  [5]: https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/ACOG-Departments/Deliveries-Before-39-Weeks/ACOG-Clinical-Guidelines?IsMobileSet=false\n  [6]: https://www.aap.org/en-us/professional-resources/quality-improvement/Pages/Guidelines-and-Policy-Development.aspx\n  [7]: https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/745942/development-clinical-practice-guidelines-guidance-statements-american-college-physicians-summary\n  [8]: https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/cancer-screening-guidelines.html\n  [9]: https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/recommendations", "18918": "Based on the most recent large-scale and high quality Cochrane review on more than 80,000 healthy adults from 52 clinical trials aged 16 to 65 years, including pregnant women, over a single influenza season in North America, South America, and Europe who received vaccination between 1969 and 2009 [(1)][1]:\n\n> 71 healthy adults need to be vaccinated to prevent one of them experiencing influenza, and 29 healthy adults need to be vaccinated to prevent one of them experiencing an influenza-like illness [(2)][2]\n\nThese statistics (i.e., 71 and 29) are called number needed to be vaccinated/treated (NNV or NNT) representing the clinical effectiveness of vaccines (NNV) or medications (NNT).

It is the large but and a large range of buts that follow.\n\nThe newborns indeed get their initial \"seeding\" by birth, [vaginally preferred][1] and from the surface of the mother's body, and everyone and everything else in the surroundings. This is facilitated by two main factors: 1. in the womb the little person is sterile 2. when born the immune system isn't fully developed. Both factors making it way more easy for bacteria \u2013 any bacteria \u2013 to take a hold.\n\n> Under physiological conditions, the fetus is protected from exposure to viable microorganisms. With rupture of membranes and passage through the birth canal, the neonate becomes exposed to bacteria that colonize maternal body surfaces and the environment. These bacteria start to establish the enteric microbiota initially characterized by low bacterial diversity and high interindividual variation. This makes the neonatal and early infant microbiota particularly vulnerable to exogenous interference. On the other hand, the low colonization resistance allows the interventional modification of the early microbiota by oral administration of beneficial bacteria. With time, additional bacterial species colonize the intestine and increase the diversity of the microbiota composition. In combination with the influence of genetic determinants and environmental factors, this ultimately leads to the generation of a mature and highly diverse enteric microbiota that remains relatively stable throughout life.\n\nThat means in later life the immune system improves its effectiveness and the ecosystem that initially develops within the gut claims all the niches that are there and defend their own existence against newly arriving species ([Hornef, 2018][2]).\n\nWe observe three very different things that make an exception to this \"stability in adult life\":\n\n1. Commensal and symbiotic bacteria (\"beneficial\") , as well as unwanted and detrimental ones (\"pathogens\"), do not exist in a vacuum but under specific, individual conditions. They feed off of your food. Altering the food composition or introducing antibiotics, natural or pharmacologically chosen, alters these conditions and can select in different directions. Antibiotics can even almost erase the ecosystem to point that makes it relatively easy for nasty bugs to spread. (For example until 1978 we called it just \"antibiotic associated colitis\", but then identified an infection/dominance with [Clostridium][3] [difficile][4] as the source for that condition.)\n\n2. In school we were told that stomach acids destroys bacteria and that therefore bacteria will not enter the body via food. For most of the bacteria this is the case.    \nObviously, we have to keep certain standards of hygiene when eating or preparing food, as E.coli or salmonella for example can make you sick, not only via their toxins, but by multiplying in your gut and replacing the previous owners of that place.\n\n3. This leads to factor 3: one or two very resilient pathogens might not cause trouble, but if they arrive in large enough numbers that chances for trouble increases. Conversely, the exact same principle is true for 'wanted' bacteria, like Mutaflor [Nissle][5], [S. boulardii][6], [Lactobacilli][7] etc. from fermented foods, sour milk/yoghurt drinks or [fecal microbiota transplants][8]. \n\nNew bacteria arrive all the time in your gut from all sides and sources and they all try very hard to survive. Many of them do not succeed. They have to arrive in sufficiently large numbers, reach the right place and 'fit in' to the existing neighbours and other conditions.\n\nThe extent to which these interactions and alterations occur are hardly predictable. In terms of 'healthy diversity' of the ecosystem in a human gut it *may* be more beneficial to not wash hands (or [even directly ingesting feces][9]) in otherwise unsanitary conditions compared to constantly bombarding the intestines with one single industrialised strain from 'pro-biotic yoghurt drinks'. But in most cases this is decidedly *not a good idea*. As you can get a really big range of really nasty infections via that 'nowash' way alone as well, it is currently advisable to look really closely at a large range of 'donor' characteristics, if this is indeed to be done as some kind of intervention. Obviously, this cannot apply to the bathroom scenario at all. \n\n> From a microbiological point of view, the human GIT can be regarded as the best investigated ecological niche of the human body, although some difficulties exist in obtaining representative samples from various parts of the GIT. Moreover, the human GIT probably represents one of the best investigated microbial ecosystems on earth. This fact can be explained due to the great importance of the GIT microbiota in maintaining and driving human health, disease and well-being: on a quantitative basis, humans can be regarded as a super-organism, consisting of 90% microbial cells and even 99% microbial genes, and the vast majority of the microbial diversity is located in the human GIT (Wilson, 2008).    \n> (Riedel, 2014)\n\nDespite the above, we still do not know nearly enough. 7 billion people, all with unique microbiomes consisting of myriads of species and strains are just too many conditions to analyse. Some of the patterns we think are emerging might be spurious. Just the very general wisdom seems to be certain by now: these mircobiomes are to be viewed as ecosystems that benefit themselves from diversity to gain stability.\n\n## References\n\nHornef, M.

Those should just never be shared or bought \"used\". First in my opinion just for the yuck factor and then only secondary because this sanitary concerns thing.\n\nYou would not want to buy toothbrushes second hand and when surgical equipment is re-used the steps to ensure complete sterility are quite rigorous. So this needs to be put into perspective and a cost-benefit analysis has to be made.\n\n\nThen in the case of an electric shaver, those blades on a cutting head will not last forever and eventually loose their edge. Some newer models seem to embrace planned obsolesence quite rigorously with a their one-blade design. That means that any cost or environmental benefit from a used razor is smaller than often imagined from the start. For shaving this is especially true: a sharp knife leads to less cutting. But blade egdes dull with use!\n\nEven electric razors are neither fool proof nor the top solution for avoiding skin problems compared to regular, mechanical  wet shave blades.    \n([Prevalence of acne keloidalis nuchae in Nigerians, 2007][4]: The common etiologic factor was secondary to trauma from an electric razor whilst having a haircut, followed by spread of keloid from the beard area.)\nThose machines often grab and tear hair out instead of cutting it. They can also get hold of skin and rip very uncomfortable wounds. \n\nAnyone choosing an electric shaver has to try them out to see if their skin and hair agree with them. But that cannot answer how well these questions were answered for the previous owner of that particular model. The previous owner sold it for a reason and if that includes lacerations than any such device should be considered a biohazard and treated as such. If you are concerned about a possible virus infection: do not buy used. (Just for completeness: you might consider applying steam, dry heat above 160\u00b0C, ethylene oxide, sporicidals, glass plasma or [gamma rays][5])\n\n\nTherefore it seems to be a bad idea to use electric shavers at all? Not really and necessarily for all.\n\n1. Do not buy used personal hygiene products.\n2. If you do buy a used electric shaver, try to exchange the screen and blades of the cutting head, effectively just reusing the motor and battery and plastic wrapping for the device.\n3. Clean the device thoroughly in any case. These cases include \"you bought it first hand and keep using it\".\n\n\nHow do you clean that device?\n\nUnfortunately, that depends a bit on the device and how it is constructed. \n\nManual tear-down, brushing and regular soap-water cleaning are a great start. But using the regular disinfectants like boiling water, rubbing alcohol, hydrogenperoxide or appropriately diluted bleach followed by thorough rinse and quick drying are even better. Alternatively you might also soak the screens and blades in commercially available dedicated disinfectants. These likely cost more but are not that much more effective to justify the cost. None of the methods mentioned so far are perfect though, anyway. Just try out what you already know is working as a sanitiser, then test that on your device. That is largely for material science. Usually those things are plastic and metal and quite resistant to those primitive chemicals you are about to use. If the device is one of the newer just wash it with water designs it will take quite some abuse in this direction without harm. \n\nThe first step reduces grime, builtup and that keeps the shaver in good operational conditions as well as diluting the bacterial load that might cause problems.     \nThe second step really kills of the bugs. The quick dry is necessary to reduce the chance of rust counteracting all your eforts and investment. Depending on construction and methods used it might also be a good idea to keep an eye on the lubrication of the mechanical parts. Washing away all the machine's oils will shorten its lifetime and your pleasure.\n\nThings to consider: [The male beard hair and facial skin - challenges for shaving. 2016][6]\n\nAdvice to try out: [Electric Shaver Maintenance 101][7] or \n[How to Sanitize an Electric Razor][8] or [Proper Sanitizing of Electric Razors][9] or [how to sterilize an electric razor head][10].\n\n\n  [1]: https://steptohealth.com/15-personal-items-never-share/\n  [2]: https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19917390/personal-hygiene-tips/\n  [3]: https://www.onlymyhealth.com/7-personal-items-you-shouldnt-share-with-anyone-1406882590\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17472675\n  [5]: https://lso-inc.com/sterilization-validation-services/medical-device-sterilization.html\n  [6]: http://The%20male%20beard%20hair%20and%20facial%20skin%20-%20challenges%20for%20shaving.\n  [7]: https://www.shavers.com/Electric-shaver-maintenance-s/1865.htm\n  [8]: https://www.livestrong.com/article/16334-sterilize-electric-razor/\n  [9]: https://oureverydaylife.com/proper-sanitizing-electric-razors-42685.html\n  [10]: https://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/159127-how-to-sterilize-an-electric-razor-head/", "16895": "Your experience that alcohol warms your fingers and the fact that the drug [nifedipine][1] is used in Raynaud's symptoms relief suggest that the mechanism involved in warming fingers is *vasodilation.*\n\nFrom the list of ingredients in your product, [**L-theanine** can cause arterial vasodilation][2] and could therefore be theoretically responsible for symptoms relief.\n\n**Caffeine** can have a vasoconstricting effect, but, according to [UpToDate][3], \"its xanthine-related properties may result in systemic vasodilation,\" which may result in fingers warming.\n\nI have not found any credible medical source that would suggest either L-theanine or caffeine for treatment of Raynaud's, though.\n\n**Melatonin** can also have a vasodilating effect ([PubMed][4]):\n\n> When ingested as a supplement in humans, melatonin enhances the\n> cutaneous vasodilating response during heating and blunts the\n> cutaneous vasoconstrictor response during cooling. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2076403\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819553\n  [3]: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044053/", "16664": "***What empirical evidence is there to with regards to methods, techniques and strategies to improve treatment noncompliance among individuals whose noncompliance is characterised by a tendency to have difficulty recalling if they have correctly adhered with their physician's dosing instructions?***\n\nThe literature is scant. However, one strategy to improve treatment adherence that is both simple, inexpensive and supported by peer-reviewed empirical evidence is the use of a pillbox.\n\nThe following relates to the use of pillboxes with respect to compliance with HART medications:\n\n> **[Pillbox Organizers are Associated with Improved Adherence to HIV Antiretroviral Therapy and Viral Suppression: a Marginal Structural Model Analysis][1]** \n>\n> Background. Pillbox organizers are inexpensive and easily used; however, their effect on adherence to antiretroviral medications is unknown.\n>\n> Methods. Data were obtained from an observational cohort of 245 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2013infected subjects who were observed from 1996 through 2000 in San Francisco, California. Adherence was the primary outcome and was measured using unannounced monthly pill counts. Plasma HIV RNA level was considered as a secondary outcome. Marginal structural models were used to estimate the effect of pillbox organizer use on adherence and viral suppression, adjusting for confounding by CD4+ T cell count, viral load, prior adherence, recreational drug use, demographic characteristics, and current and past treatment.\n>\n> Results. Pillbox organizer use was estimated to improve adherence by 4.1%\u20134.5% and was associated with a decrease in viral load of 0.34\u20130.37 log10 copies/mL and a 14.2%\u201315.7% higher probability of achieving a viral load \u2a7d400 copies/mL (odds ratio, 1.8\u20131.9). All effect estimates were statistically significant.\n>\n> Conclusion. Pillbox organizers appear to significantly improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and to improve virologic suppression. We estimate that pillbox organizers may be associated with a cost of \u223c$19,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Pillbox organizers should be a standard intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\nHowever, caution should be exercised before inferring that there might be benefit to the use of pillboxes in relation to other pharmacotherapies e.g. antihypertensives.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nWith regards to polypharmacy involving three or more agents e.g. chronic or more complicated conditions, the following meta-analysis seems to suggest that there is no benefit of reminder devices on medication adherence relative to the use of pillboxes:\n\n> **[Effect of Reminder Devices on Medication Adherence: the REMIND Randomized Clinical Trial Links][2]**\n>\n> Objective: To compare the effect of 3 low-cost reminder devices on medication adherence.\n>\n> Design, Setting, and Participants: This 4-arm, block-randomized clinical trial involved 53\u202f480 enrollees of CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager, across the United States. Eligible participants were aged 18 to 64 years and taking 1 to 3 oral medications for long-term use. Participants had to be suboptimally adherent to all of their prescribed therapies (with a medication possession ratio of 30% to 80%) in the 12 months before randomization. Participants were stratified on the basis of the medications they were using at randomization: medications for cardiovascular or other nondepression chronic conditions (the chronic disease stratum) and antidepressants (the antidepressant stratum). In each stratum, randomization occurred within blocks defined by whether all of the patient's targeted medications were dosed once daily. Patients were randomized to receive in the mail a pill bottle strip with toggles, digital timer cap, or standard pillbox. The control group received neither notification nor a device. Data were collected from February 12, 2013, through March 21, 2015, and data analyses were on the intention-to-treat population.\n>\n> Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was optimal adherence (medication possession ratio \u226580%) to all eligible medications among patients in the chronic disease stratum during 12 months of follow-up, ascertained using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes included optimal adherence to cardiovascular medications among patients in the chronic disease stratum as well as optimal adherence to antidepressants.\n>\n> Results: Of the 53\u202f480 participants, mean (SD) age was 45 (12) years and 56% were female. In the primary analysis, 15.5% of patients in the chronic disease stratum assigned to the standard pillbox, 15.1% assigned to the digital timer cap, 16.3% assigned to the pill bottle strip with toggles, and 15.1% assigned to the control arm were optimally adherent to their prescribed treatments during follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of optimal adherence between the control and any of the devices (standard pillbox: odds ratio [OR],\u20091.03 [95% CI, 0.95-1.13]; digital timer cap: OR,\u20091.00 [95% CI, 0.92-1.09]; and pill bottle strip with toggles: OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85-1.04]). **In direct comparisons, the odds of optimal adherence were higher with a standard pillbox than with the pill bottle strip (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.00-1.21]). Secondary analyses yielded similar results.**\n>\n> Conclusions and Relevance: **Low-cost reminder devices did not improve adherence among nonadherent patients who were taking up to 3 medications to treat common chronic conditions.** The devices may have been more effective if coupled with interventions to ensure consistent use or if targeted to individuals with an even higher risk of nonadherence.\n>\n>  Importance: Forgetfulness is a major contributor to nonadherence to chronic disease medications and could be addressed with medication reminder devices.\n\nIn the above analysis, we do note that use of a standard pillbox does seem to improve adherence when compared with a pill bottle strip (OR = 1.10).\n\nHowever, as meta-analyses are susceptible to regression to the mean, caution must also be exercised as well. \n\nIt's prudent to note that no peer reviewed evidence will be able to demonstrate that pillboxes or any other method, technique or strategy does or does not not work for any one individual for any variant of pharmacotherapy for any period of time in their life. \n\nIn short: individual differences, bro.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://doi.org/10.1086/521250\n  [2]: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2605527", "16433": "When you do not get enough nutrients from food, your blood glucose levels tend to fall, which triggers the release of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline).

Several different theories have been proposed on why vaccines could cause autism, such as the ingredient in some vaccines thimerosal being harmful, but these have all been disproved by many different experiments.\n\nMany reliable sources such as the [CDC<sup>1</sup>][1] says that there is no link between autism an vaccines. A [2011 report<sup>2</sup>][2] from the Institute of Medicine that tested 8 different vaccines on both adults and children showed that the vaccines are very safe.\n\n> A [2013 CDC study<sup>3</sup>][3] added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body\u2019s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life. The results showed that the total amount of antigen from vaccines received was the same between children with ASD and those that did not have ASD.\n\nThe CDC has also funded many other studies on vaccine ingredients and their links to autism, especially [thimerosal<sup>4</sup>][4], a mercury-based ingredient used in some vaccines. These studies have shown \"no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children.\" \n\n[Full list of CDC studies on the link between vaccines and autism<sup>5</sup>][5]\n\nThese are pretty convincing, but you can't just rely on one source, right? \n\n-------\n\n[An issue in the Oxford Journal<sup>6</sup>][6] also shows how even though there have been many claims that vaccines do cause autism, there aren't any studies that help support this claim. \n\n> A worldwide increase in the rate of autism diagnoses\u2014likely driven by broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness\u2014has fueled concerns that an environmental exposure like vaccines might cause autism. Theories for this putative association have centered on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines currently administered. However, both epidemiological and biological studies fail to support these claims.\n\n[One study that took place in the UK from 1979-1992<sup>7</sup>][7] found that even though there was an increase in cases of autism, there was no jump in the amount of cases when the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, another controversial vaccine, was introduced in 1988.\n\n[A 2003 study in metropolitan Atlanta<sup>8</sup>][8], Georgia compared the ages that the MMR vaccine was given in children with autism against the age that children without autism received it. The results were that the proportion of time that children were vaccinated in both control groups was similar. \n\nThe Oxford Journal entry mentioned many other studies that tested the link between MMR vaccines and autism and there has been no plausible evidence.\n\nThe other vaccine ingredient that is also said to cause autism is thimerosal, which I mentioned before. The Oxford Journal issue also shows studies about this link.\n\n[A study in Finland<sup>9</sup>][9] helped show that there wasn't a link between thimerosal and autism. In fact, cases of autism increased in 1992 after thimerosal-containing vaccines were discontinued. \n\n[Another study in the UK<sup>10</sup>][10] also disproved the theory that thimerosal causes autism. They actually found that thimerosal-containing vaccines might even have a beneficial effect in children.\n\nThere have also been many other studies that invalidate the link between thimerosal and autism. \n\nOne last theory that has been proposed is that multiple vaccines being administered to a child simultaneously can weaken their immune system and cause autism. This theory is flawed for several reasons.\n\n[This article<sup>11</sup>][11] used data from many studies and found that vaccines do not overwhelm and weaken an infant's immune system. Infants are able to respond well to the many vaccines that are given to them.\n\n[Another study<sup>12</sup>][12] found that vaccines did not weaken the immune system to any diseases. They were unable to find consistent relationship between infectious diseases and immunization.\n\n-------\n\nAll of this scientific evidence leaves one question left to be answered. \n\n**Why do any people believe that vaccines cause autism?** (this part will get some more opinion then you may like, but it is necessary)\n\n[A fraudulent 1998 study<sup>13</sup>][13] by Andrew Wakefield and colleagues was one of the main reasons that this controversy over vaccines and autism began. It [used falsified data<sup>14</sup>][14] to support their claim that the MMR vaccine caused developmental problems and other autism symptoms. This study has since been retracted as it was demonstrated to be false. Dr. Wakefield, a physician in the UK, was struck off the Medical Registry due to his participation in this fraud.\n\n[WebMD<sup>15</sup>][15] also talks about why there are still some people that believe that vaccines are the cause of autism.\n\n> And when something bad happens to a child, people demand to know what or whom is to blame. \"Parents are clamoring for a cause,\" says David Tayloe, MD, a pediatrician in Greensboro, N.C., and president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\n>\n> \"It's a terrible condition. It upsets families, and it upsets me.\" But all the fear and anger about vaccines is misplaced, he says. \"There's just nothing there.\"\n \nIt seems most people who claim that vaccines cause autism are just looking for something to blame for what is happening to children. Many parents may become angry when they find out their child has autism, and they put that anger against vaccines. \n\nThere are some logical arguments that people may present, such as changing of their child's behavior after receiving vaccines. This is mostly coincidence, as most children are vaccinated around the same time autism symptoms begin to appear (usually 12-18 months)<sup>[16]</sup>. Other than this and some of the arguments mentioned earlier, there is almost no reason to believe that vaccines cause autism.\n\n-------\n\n<sup>[[1]]  [CDC - Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism][1]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[2]]  [Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality][2]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[3]]  [Increasing Exposure to Antibody-Stimulating Proteins and Polysaccharides in Vaccines Is Not Associated with Risk of Autism][3]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[4]]  [CDC - Frequently Asked Questions About Thimerosal][4]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[5]]  [CDC - Vaccines and Autism: A Summary of CDC Conducted or Sponsored Studies][5]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[6]]  [Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses][6]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[7]]  [Autism and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: no epidemiological evidence for a causal association][7]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[8]]  [Age at First Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination in Children With Autism and School-Matched Control Subjects: A Population-Based Study in Metropolitan Atlanta][8]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[9]]  [Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data][9]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[10]]  [Thimerosal Exposure in Infants and Developmental Disorders: A Prospective Cohort Study in the United Kingdom Does Not Support a Causal Association][10]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[11]]  [Addressing Parents\u2019 Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm or Weaken the Infant\u2019s Immune System?][11]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[12]]  [DTP Immunization and Susceptibility to Infectious Diseases][12]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[13]]  [RETRACTED: Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children][13]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[14]]  [The MMR vaccine and autism: Sensation, refutation, retraction, and fraud][15]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[15]]  [WebMD - Autism-Vaccine Link: Evidence Doesn't Dispel Doubts][15]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[16]]  [When do children usually show symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?][16]</sup>\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK190024/\n  [3]: http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/pdf\n  [4]: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html\n  [5]: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/00_pdf/CDCStudiesonVaccinesandAutism.pdf\n  [6]: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full\n  [7]: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)01239-8/abstract\n  [8]: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/2/259.abstract?ijkey=dc1d00324fa8cd6bb885c9cb3ab0e919d0b62a53&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n  [9]: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/3/604.abstract?ijkey=e453250183c05a382ba493c5ffcfbd44ed3fac79&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n  [10]: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/577.abstract?ijkey=02f2f424eae1686eeaa627cd2e939a39a0bbf3b4&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\n  [11]: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/109/1/124.full#sec-16\n  [12]: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=515726\n  [13]: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/\n  [15]: http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/searching-for-answers/vaccines-autism\n  [16]: https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/Pages/symptoms-appear.aspx", "15663": "Cheese and meat are both high in fat, which slows down the emptying of the stomach content (including tea) into the small intestine more than carbohydrate foods (vegetables and grains).

For an MR scan, patients typically have to be placed in a long, narrow tube [2]. Thus, claustrophobia preventing MR imaging is a common problem. **Between 1% and 15% of all patients scheduled for MR imaging suffer from claustrophobia** and cannot be imaged, or they require sedation to complete the scan (mean: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 2.0% to 2.5%) [3]. Thus it can be estimated that worldwide approximately 2,000,000 MR procedures cannot be performed or are prematurely terminated due to claustrophobia. At an average cost of \u20ac 500 per MR imaging, this is equal to a loss of productivity of \u20ac 1 billion, which is an important financial loss for the health care system. Therefore, claustrophobia is not only a common problem that prevents many patients from benefiting from the findings obtained with MR imaging but also represents an important socioeconomic issue for the health care system.\n\nSo, if MRI patients are representative of the general population, that means 1-5%.  But this group is already selected by having agreed to the procedure so the prevalence rate is likely higher.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045881/\n\nThere's a theory that claustrophobia is related to personal space projection\n\n> We all move around in a protective bubble of \"near space,\" more commonly known as \"personal space.\" But not everyone's bubble is the same size. People who project their personal space too far beyond their bodies, or the norm of arm's reach, are more likely to experience claustrophobic fear, a new study finds. The study is one of the first to focus on the perceptual mechanisms of claustrophobic fear.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110412065809.htm\n\nbut in mice, a claustrophobia phenotype has been described to a single gene defect\n\n> Claustrophobia, the well-known fear of being trapped in narrow/closed spaces, is often considered a conditioned response to traumatic experience. Surprisingly, we found that mutations affecting a single gene, encoding a stress-regulated neuronal protein, can cause claustrophobia. Gpm6a-deficient mice develop normally and lack obvious behavioral abnormalities. However, when mildly stressed by single-housing, these mice develop a striking claustrophobia-like phenotype, which is not inducible in wild-type controls, even by severe stress. The human GPM6A gene is located on chromosome 4q32-q34, a region linked to panic disorder. Sequence analysis of 115 claustrophobic and non-claustrophobic subjects identified nine variants in the noncoding region of the gene that are more frequent in affected individuals (P=0.028). One variant in the 3\u2032untranslated region was linked to claustrophobia in two small pedigrees. This mutant mRNA is functional but cannot be silenced by neuronal miR124 derived itself from a stress-regulated transcript. We suggest that loosing dynamic regulation of neuronal GPM6A expression poses a genetic risk for claustrophobia.\n\nsuggesting a biological underpinning.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/tp201328\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any data linking height to claustrophobia.", "15402": "Head sweating and flushing after eating or just smelling or thinking about a certain food is called **gustatory sweating.**\n\n[MedicineNet][1]:\n\n> Gustatory sweating: Sweating on the forehead, face, scalp, and neck\n> occurring soon after ingesting food.

The bone itself has hardly any nerve endings, it is only the periosteum that causes pain. This only works in a few cases. Other options include administration of pain killers. \n\nA few \u201cguidelines\u201d what to do when:\n\n 1. If the patient is in pain, call an ambulance.\n 2. If the patient can not walk/stand up, call an ambulance.\n 3. If the fracture is open (ruptured skin / blood), call an ambulance.\n 4. If the patient was or still is unconscious, call an ambulance, check for vital functions (breathing, airways).\n 5. If the patient wants an ambulance, call the ambulance.\n\nBottom line: To be on the safe side, call an ambulance.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n## What *can* you do? ##\nDuring my very first first-help training, my trainer said something that stuck with me: \u201cWe humans have two fundamental fears: To die, and to die alone\u201d. While it is sometimes impossible to save someone\u2019s life, we can always, always be with them and comfort them. \nSo, never leave a patient alone unless there is absolute need, and if so, communicate clearly that you will return very shortly and e.g. just need to grab an AED.\n\nSecondly, being in pain is not very enjoyable, and having a large crowd of bystanders assemble around the patient doesn\u2019t make it a bit better. Try to give them the decency of privacy. If you have already called the ambulance, get a few people to spread out, watch out for the ambulance and guide them to the patient. Hush the other ones away or give them tasks like looking for AEDs in nearby public buildings.\n\nThirdly, lying immobilised, the patient gets cold quite quickly. Make sure to keep them warm. Jackets, <s>a camp fire</s>, or a [rescue blanket][2] are always a good idea, even on mild summer days. (Pro Tip: A rescue blanket makes it quite clear to the ambulance drivers where and who the patient is, and it also protects the patient from the watchful eyes of bystanders. Such blankets are usually a part of every first-aid set in public buildings).\n\nLastly, as a patient you are very dependent on the people around you. Because patients are usually sitting and leaning against a wall or lying on the ground (to prevent meaningful damage if they should collapse), their field of vision is very limited. Pain also distracts, so they are not highly aware of their surroundings. \nThis is why one must explain every action one takes to them, especially if it includes coming very near or touching the patient.\n\n## TL;DR ##\n\nHere\u2019s what you could do (order and items on the list depend on every case, don\u2019t take this as a standard rule). Reiterating from above, always tell the patient what you\u2019re doing.\n\n 1. Check vital functions\n 2. Call ambulance\n 3. Check vital functions again\n 4. Direct someone to get a first-aid set from a nearby public building.  \n 5.

Objective: To describe the definition, extent, and factors associated with overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) in the United States as perceived by ED directors.[\u2026] Conclusions: Episodic, but frequent, overcrowding is a significant problem in academic, county, and private hospital EDs in urban and rural settings. Its causes are complex and multifactorial. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a systemic and structural problem of those politics we chose to endure and tolerate.\n\n\n> [Overcrowding in the nation\u2019s emergency departments: Complex causes and disturbing effects:][5] Ten years ago, serious overcrowding in emergency departments became a national issue. Although temporary improvement of the problem occurred, the issue of ED overcrowding has now resurfaced and threatens to become worse. Overcrowding is caused by a complex web of interrelated issues described in this article. ED overcrowding has multiple effects, including placing the patient at risk for poor outcome, prolonged pain and suffering of some patients, long patient waits, patient dissatisfaction, ambulance diversions in some cities, decreased physician productivity, increased frustration among medical staff, and violence. Solving the problem of overcrowding will not only require a major financial commitment from the federal government and local hospitals, but will also require a cooperation from managed care. Unless the problem is solved in the near future, the general public may no longer be able to rely on EDs for quality and timely emergency care, placing the people of this country at risk. \nAmong the reasons listed, there are quite a few redundant words used:\n\n1. Increased complexity and acuity of patients presenting to the ED\n2. Overall increase in patient volume\n3. Managed care problems.\n4. Lack of beds for patients admitted to the hospital.\n5. Avoiding inpatient hospital admission by \u201cintensive therapy\u201d in the ED.\n6. Delays in service provided by radiology, laboratory, and ancillary services.\n7. Shortage of nursing staff\n8. Shortage of administrative/clerical support staff\n9. Shortage of on-call specialty consultants or lack of availability.\n10. Shortage of physical plant space within the ED\n11. Problems with language and cultural barriers.\n12. Shortage of house staff who rotate through teaching hospital EDs\n13. Increased medical record documentation requirements.\n14. Difficulty in arranging follow-up care.\n\nNotice there are factors indicating increased quality of health care: overall numbers increase is partially the result of better quality leading to an ageing population. Then there is this stupid taylorised over documentation for quality controlling (McKinseyed to death), thought of as good idea, terrible outcome in current practice.\n\nBut most indicative in this analysis:\n\n[Shortages][6] everywhere!

In this study, only 69 out of 696 cycles were regular.\n\n> Ovulation occurred as early as the eighth day and as late as the 60th day of the menstrual cycle. \u200bFigure1 shows the distribution of fertile days, generated by the smoothed distribution of ovulation days. Overall, an estimated 2% of women were in their fertile window by the fourth day of their cycle and 17% by the seventh day (based on 213 women). This percentage peaked on days 12 and 13, when 54% of women were in their fertile window. If ovulation was delayed, women reached their fertile days much later. Among women who reached the fifth week of their cycle, 4-6% were in their fertile window.\n>\n> Current clinical guidelines about a woman's potentially fertile days have been based on two assumptions\u2014that ovulation occurs 14 days before the next menses and that women are fertile for several days before and after ovulation. It follows that in the usual menstrual cycle lasting 28 days, the fertile days would fall between days 10 and 17.15 The assumptions are, however, outdated. Firstly, only a small percentage of women ovulate exactly 14 days before the onset of menses. This is true even for women whose cycles are usually 28 days long. **Among the 69 cycles for 28 days in our study, ovulation occurred 14 days before the next menses in only 10%. Time from ovulation to next menses ranged from 7 to 19 days (days 10 to 22 of the menstrual cycle).** Thus, the fertile window can occur much earlier or later in the cycle than clinical guidelines suggest. On average, at least 10% of women with regular cycles were in their fertile window on any given day of their cycle between days 6 and 21. The timing of the fertile window is even less predictable for women with less regular cycles, which includes adolescents and women in their perimenopause.\n\n<sup> [**The timing of the \u201cfertile window\u201d in the menstrual cycle: day specific estimates from a prospective study** *BMJ. 2000 Nov 18; 321(7271): 1259\u20131262.

And of course you can/may eat, for example nuts, after brushing your teeth. It depends on the timing. And of course: the way this question is phrased it is more along the lines of \"Is it a good idea to brush teeth, then eat nuts and then go to sleep?\"\n\nThen the answer is a definite no.\n\nMy friend the dentist used to say: \"A clean tooth is a healthy tooth\"; so that commercial is not as bad as advertisements usually go.\n\n---\n\n[Sugar][1] is just a subtype of [carbohydrates][2] and carbohydrate digestion actually starts in your mouth. The starch [amylose][3] from potatoes for example is broken down by the [enzyme][4] called [amylase][5] found in your saliva into [maltose][6]. This a disaccharide like common table sugar and food for acid producing and [cariogenic][7] bacteria.\n\n[The amount of carbohydrates contained in the things you eat varies, but is very seldom zero (especially if the food is *somehow prepared/processed*).][8]\n\n[Starches][9], especially [processed ones][10], tend to [cling to your teeth][10] and prolong the time the bacteria have an ample [supply of food to produce cariogenic acid][11] and multiply themselves. That means bread after brushing is a foolishly stupid idea.\n\nSince you will not be able able to avoid any and all carbohydrate intake for eternity it is already self-evident that never brushing again is not the smartest choice available. But aside from tooth decay caused by carbohydrate metabolising bacteria (that you now have *'avoided in theory'*) there is an additional aspect that will come into play even if total 'no-carb diet' was to be followed through:\n\nDental calculus or tartar buildup (From: \"Supragingival Calculus: Formation and Control\"):\n> [Dental calculus is composed of inorganic components and organic matrix. Brushite, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, octacalcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, and whitlockite form the mineral part of dental calculus. Salivary proteins selectively adsorb on the tooth surface to form an acquired pellicle. It is followed by the adherence of various oral micro-organisms. Fimbriae, flagella, and some other surface proteins are essential for microbial adherence. Microbial co-aggregation and co-adhesion enable some micro-organisms, which are incapable of adhering, to adhere to the pellicle-coated tooth surface. Once organisms attach to the tooth surface, new genes could be expressed so that mature dental plaque can form and biofilm bacteria assume increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Supersaturation of saliva and plaque fluid with respect to calcium phosphates is the driving force for plaque mineralization. Both salivary flow rate and plaque pH appear to influence the saturation degree of calcium phosphates. Acidic phospholipids and specific proteolipids present in cell membranes play a key role in microbial mineralization.][12] \n\nThis is problematic because they are [Dental biofilms: difficult therapeutic targets (10.1034/j.1600-0757.2002.280102.x):][13]\n\n> Periodontal diseases are infections caused by micro-organisms that colonize the tooth surface at or below the gingival margin. While these infections have many properties in common with other infectious diseases, they exhibit unique properties conferred by their site of colonization and the nature of the en- vironment in which they reside.\n\nNever brushing again will certainly shorten your life you live in comfort, regardless of how extreme you try to adapt your dietary ideas.

When you suddenly stand, the blood returning to your heart in insufficient to supply your brain *momentarily* (i.e. your *cardiac output* decreases.) The answer is, indeed, getting up slowly. \n\nIn addition, keeping well hydrated may help; Since in a supine position the venous capacitance is high, move the muscles in your legs - all of them from your toes up - to increase blood return to the heart.

It is implicated in various other conditions such as psychosis, and Parkinson's disease (9).\n\nNoradrenaline (NE - norepinephrine in North America) is a catecholamine neurotransmitter that plays a role in attention and arousal (9). NE is produced from DA. (5)\n\nSerotonin (5-HT) in an indolamine. 5-HT modulates mood, aggression, dominance, appetite, and sleep (9). \n\n<h1>The pathogenesis of ADHD</h1>\nThe most prevalent theory of the pathogenesis of ADHD is that it results from an \"deficiency\" of some of the various monoamine neurotransmitters. DA, NE, and to a lesser degree 5-HT, are all implicated (5)(6). DA is the neurotransmitter most heavily associated with ADHD, and its role in the mediation of the disease was primarily elucidated by methylphenidate's effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission (6).\n\n<h1>Pharmacodynamics of antidepressants</h1>\n\nDifferent antidepressants work through different mechanisms. The major  antidepressants are segregated into three classes: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), TCAs, and SSRIs. \n\nMAOIs \"increase\" the levels of all of the monoamine (DA, NE, and 5-HT, among others) neurotransmitters by preventing the deamination of these neurotransmitters by inhibiting the activity of the monoamine oxidase (8).\n\nThe affinities for different transporter proteins varies widely in the TCA class. TCAs are generally considered to inhibit the reuptake of NE and 5-HT, although this varies greatly from TCA to TCA. Clomipramine, for instance, has a much higher affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) than the noradrenaline transporter (NET) (7). Amitriptyline has relatively balanced 5-HT and NE action, whereas desipramine and nortriptyline very selective for NET. (7)\n\nSSRIs (as the name suggests) are most potent at inhibiting SERT. \n\n<h1>The role of antidepressants in the treatment of ADHD</h1>\nTricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) are the main class of antidepressants used to treat ADHD typically in conjunction with a stimulant. Most TCAs inhibit the reuptake of NE into the presynaptic clef. This is a mode of action shared with stimulant medications. Their efficacy in the remediation of ADHD symptoms is inferior to that of the stimulants (3). Due to the lack of action on dopamine neurotransmission, TCAs only treat the hyperactive element of ADHD - in other words, they often fail to improve concentration (3). Desipramine, because of its selectivity for NE reuptake inhibition, is the TCA most frequently used for ADHD (2). \n\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are occasionally used in conjuction with stimulants (3). Contaminant use of fluoxetine with a stimulant results in a significant increase in school performance, and attenuation of irritability: *\"things that used to bother me a whole don't seem to bother me much anymore\"* (3). Low serotonin is associated with impulsivity and aggression (3). It's hypothesized in (3) that fluoxetine may influence the brain's response to DA. \n\n<h1>References</h1>\n\n 1.

The form of stress may be physical or emotional. Since the control of aldosterone is partly under the influence of the brain, any type of nervous stimulus or mental stress can affect its secretion. \n\nWhen an individual has physical stress, there is increased release of the stress hormones, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon and cortisol, all of which can affect urination. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nCatecholamines - Direct and Indirect Renal Effects\n---------------------------------- \nTwo of these \"fight or flight hormones\" - epinephrine and norepinephrine have direct and indirect effects on urine production. When these hormones act directly on the kidneys and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) remains constant. \n The result is a decrease in urinary output.  Conversely, the indirect effects of these hormones increase MAP, resulting in increased urine output. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nAldosterone\n-----------\nIt\u2019s role is to regulate blood pressure and sodium levels.  Water, sodium and aldosterone levels are all directly related.  When your body\u2019s aldosterone levels are high \u2013 so are your levels of sodium and water.  thus less is secreted. This reverse of this process also holds true.\n\nSince the control of aldosterone is partly under the influence of the brain, any type of nervous stimulus can affect its secretion. \n\n----------\n\n\nCortisol and ADH\n--------------\nUnder chronic stress this works slightly differently. First cortisol levels will increase.  This leads to decreased levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which results in increased urination. As stress levels remain high cortisol levels eventually drop. Your adrenal gland becomes unable to produce sufficient levels of aldosterone \u2013 which once again causes an increase in urination. \n\n----------\n**Sources**<br>\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11116129/\nhttp://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/192/1/131\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190050/\n\n", "13156": "Your question contains a number of over simplifications.

How much is enough?\n\nIn fact there are exercise programmes, known as [cardiac rehabilitation](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rehab) designed to help those who have had some forms of cardiac disease or procedures-- including stent insertions. Cardiac rehabilitation has evidence to suggest that it is a beneficial programme for those who have suffered eg heart attacks or who who have had stents. \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that [exercise shortly following stent insertion is safe](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/42/9/1569) too; though perhaps inadvisable in the context of having a sore groin from the femoral access used.\n\nCertain types of exercise, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) [may protect stent function](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870309006553), though it should be noted that the study that suggested this had a relatively small sample size. It may have [other beneficial effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962772), but again note 1) small sample size and 2) a surrogate marker (*heart rate variability* (HRV)).\n\nIt should be reasonable to conclude that other factors notwithstanding some forms of exercise is not harmful in and of itself following a stent. Of course, **context is everything**- if those 'other factors' were that a person who has had a stent is terribly unfit and so has very poor heart function, or has other significant co-morbidities, or similar it may not be safe for them to exercise!\n\nAnd so to the next point:\n\n# Why isn't there research to say if me running this marathon is safe? Why wouldn't my doctor tell me it's safe to run in the LA marathon?\n\n'Why' questions can be tricky to answer; but in brief it may be tricky to do good, conclusive research as to whether having a stent affects marathon running. Research or trial design is a very broad topic to go into (it's a science unto itself), but it's hard to do well at the best of times. In this particular case there are several potential pitfalls.\n\nStent or not, [some people die during marathons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23989386). This may be due to [cardiac arrest](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468) or in the context of [sudden cardiac death](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/28/2/428).\n\nSo, say you have someone who sadly dies during a marathon, and they have a stent. How do you work out whether they died due to it not being safe to run because they have a stent, or for another reason? Stent or not, were they fit to run- are they a previously fit-and-healthy individual with a background of running before their procedure, or were they a sedentary individual who had a heart attack out the blue and leapt 'off the couch' to get fit after they had to have stents put in?\n\nIn the absence of evidence, it's a judgement call. I can't and wouldn't wish speak for your doctor, but if they were to tell you that based on you being previously fit and well, and that you are doing well following the procedure you should be fine; if you then were to have something adverse happen, you may decide they had advised you poorly.\n\nThat being said, there is a [programme for those with stents (and other medical devices) to be sponsored to enter a marathon](http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/about/foundation/global-heroes/guidelines.html); I am not affiliated with them. It's also worth pointing out that one of the requirements is that the putative runner:\n\n> Certify they have consulted with a physician who deems the runner medically fit to participate in the race.\n\nSo there you go.

For any specific questions, talk to your doctor.*\n\nEpiPen is an injection of Epinephrine (also called Adrenaline) that is indicated for treatment of anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock), which is a clinical representation of the most severe systemic allergic reactions. Anaphylactic shock may have multiple signs and symptoms, such as: urticaria and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; hypotension; cardiac arrhythmias; unconsciousness and shock (this is an incomplete list, see picture and references for more).\n\n[![Signs and Symptoms of Anaphylaxis][1]][1]\n\nAll these adverse reactions occur in the context of an IgE-mediated mechanism. IgE is a type of antibody, which is released in huge amounts in the body when a person is exposed to any type of allergen which they are sensitive to following a first exposure (of course, different people may have different allergies; some may have several, some may have none).\nWhen IgE antibodies are released in the body, they cause multiple effects that comprise the anaphylactic shock (some were mentioned above, see references below for others).\n\n[![Anaphylactic Reaction][2]][2]\n\nEpinephrine is a natural hormone that is responsible for the activation of the [sympathetic nervous system][3]. For example, it can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, it can cause dilation of the bronchi (which allows to breathe better) and other effects. For this reason, it is used as a medication for anaphylaxis, since it can reverse many of its symptoms (i.e. hypotension, bronchoconstriction etc.).\n\nIt is worth noting that being a natural hormone, if Epinephrine is taken orally, it is broken down in the stomach rather quickly. That is the reason it has to be given by injection.\n\nI will answer some of your questions specifically:\n\n1. Epinephrine will usually begin to have an effect in a few minutes, which is important for a medication given for a life-threatening condition (anaphylaxis).\n2. There are several ways to administer Epinephrine. It is agreed upon that the most beneficial method is to inject it into the thigh muscle.\n3. Epipen is used to treat anaphylactic shock **regardless** of the allergy that caused it. No matter which allergen caused the shock, anaphylaxis is the same for all people (it is an immunologic reaction of the human body). Therefore, whether it is caused by exposure to latex, bee sting, milk etc., a person in anaphylactic shock should receive the proper dose of Epinephrine as soon as possible (there is an adult dose of 0.3 mg and a child dose of 0.15 mg).\n4. For the actual method of administration (which is a very important thing to know, for everyone), you can ask a healthcare professional or watch clips on YouTube, such as [this one][4]. (important: one of the things people overlook many times is the fact that you have to inject the medication, **HOLD IT IN** for 10 seconds and then pull the injector out).\n\nFor further information, you can check out the [EpiPen official website][5] and the following texts:\n\n[Adrenaline in the treatment of anaphylaxis: what is the evidence?][6]\n\n[Epinephrine: The Drug of Choice for Anaphylaxis--A Statement of the World Allergy Organization][7]\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQChs.jpg\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/VIar8.jpg\n  [3]: https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/sympathetic_nervous_system.htm\n  [4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YheJhyQ168Y\n  [5]: https://www.epipen.com/en/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC286326/\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3666145/", "9714": "Yawns are \"contagious\" in that [other people](http://cpl.revues.org/390) ([and even dogs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610100/)) often yawn in response to seeing someone else yawn.

Therefore, this study combined the WBC count with the platelet count, which initially goes down in most patients with infection [[3]](http://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2052-0492-1-9), to try to improve discrimination between the two conditions.

That is a *cognitive bias* (a belief based on a construct, not objective evidence). Taking your example, I would ask you, what beneficial purpose does a runny/stuffy nose serve? Does it facilitate viral removal? Is it necessary to full recovery from a cold? Is long-term immunity to a rhinovirus enhanced if no symptomatic treatment is rendered?\n\n*Do you have any evidence that not treating symptoms is beneficial?*\n\n>...why do we take medicines to suppress our symptoms?\n\nFirst, let me clarify that symptoms are neither \"good\" nor \"bad\"; they merely **inform** (although one can argue that *the absence of symptoms* is a good thing.) Illness/disease/disorder is present. Thanks to them, now we know, and we can treat (or not treat) the underlying disorder. But the symptoms themselves are merely the body's reactions; they aren't necessarily *good*. Sometimes mild symptoms aren't treated, but the decision to treat is based on how disruptive (and/or dangerous) they are. \n\nLet's assume only 'relatively benign' symptoms, for example a runny nose, sore throat and cough that typically results from infection with a rhinovirus (the most common cause of the common cold). \n\nPeople treat a runny nose because it bothers them. It's hard to breathe easily with a runny nose, and the mere presence of nasal congestion causes a mild and very annoying feeling of air hunger in many people. Mouth-breathing dehydrates the oropharynx and upper airway, making a sore throat worse, worsens coughs, and makes sleep difficult, resulting in daytime drowsiness, irritability, etc. Overall, it's uncomfortable. The same applies to the sore throat: it makes eating, drinking, swallowing, and communication uncomfortable. Coughing (and sneezing) causes increased pain in sore throats, can keep people awake, spreads illness through  aerosolized droplets (making for awkward social interactions), etc. The benefit of *not treating* these symptoms is largely unknown; **the benefit** of treating these symptoms (which supports the multi-billion dollar cold remedy industry) is that it just makes people feel better overall. They sleep better, cough less, feel less achey, swallow with less discomfort, etc. That's why people treat their cold symptoms. \n\n>The morbidity associated with non\u2013influenza-related VRTI is not trivial. ...the total economic impact [in the US] of non\u2013influenza-related [Viral respiratory tract infection] approaches $40 billion annually (direct costs, $17 billion per year; and indirect costs, $22.5 billion per year).\n\nSome of the deleterious effects of rhinovirus infection are known (production of chemokines by epithelial cells resulting in influx of leukocytes into the airway leading to airway pathology; release of inflammatory cell products from neutrophils, cationic protein release from eosinophils, reactive oxygen species, etc., which can cause tissue damage.) However, *the benefit of not treating a rhinovirus infection* is unknown.\n\nThis means that unless and until benefits are shown of *not treating* symptoms, the [risk to benefit ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93benefit_ratio) of treatment of the common cold is incompletely known. In that event, the practice will favor treatment.\n\nMy hope in answering this question is to shed light on the potential harm of teleological arguments, that they need to be discarded in favor of objective evidence. Things are not true because one believes them to be true; to quote Philip K. Dick, \"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.\"\n\n<sub>This answer ignores obvious risks of treatment, such as decongestants in hypertensives, etc. which are present on information labels on OTC medications, and the risks of treatments without well-known benefit, e.g. Vitamin C supplements.</sub>  \n<sub>[The common cold](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603121629)</sub>  \n<sub>[The Economic Burden of Non\u2013Influenza-Related Viral Respiratory Tract Infection in the United States](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=215118&resultclick=1)</sub>  \n<sub>[Role of Viral Infections, Atopy and Antiviral Immunity in the Etiology of Wheezing Exacerbations Among Children and Young Adults](http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/2005/11001/Role_of_Viral_Infections,_Atopy_and_Antiviral.11.aspx)</sub>  \n<sub>[How Viral Infections Cause Exacerbation of Airway Diseases](http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1084743)</sub>\n", "4064": "**Odds vary.**\n\nThe most straightforward study I could find was [Koumantaki et al.

The higher the odds ratio, the greater the chance of the individual inheriting the disease. From this, it is easy to see that those with mothers with rheumatoid arthritis were more likely to inherit it, especially if the individuals were female.\n\nA different study, [the GoRA study (summary)](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.123251!/file/GORA-Newsletter.pdf) found that\n> if one of your parents, or a sibling (one of your brothers or sisters) has RA, your risk of developing RA will be slightly higher (around a 16% chance) than someone that does not have a family member affected with this illness (around a 0.8% chance).\n\nThis would seem to give an odds ratio of about 20 - much higher than any of the other results.\n\nIn addition, I've found numbers from [Arthritis Research UK](http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/arthritis-and-daily-life/pregnancy-and-arthritis/what-are-the-chances-of-my-child-having-arthritis.aspx) (no studies cited) which says that the probability of a child getting rheumatoid arthritis from a parent is about 1-3%.\n\nGoing even further, a [*New York Times* Health article](http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/rheumatoid-arthritis/print.html) claims that\n> Some people may inherit genes that make them more susceptible to developing RA, but a family history of RA does not appear to increase an individual's risk.\n\nIt also goes along with Koumantaki et al.'s findings that women are more likely to get the disease than men.\n\nIt seems like the jury is still out on this, although most studies of the genetics behind rheumatoid arthritis focus on which genes might be transferred, or related hypotheses.

Fitness includes how well it can survive in its environment and how much it can produce vital offspring. \n\n> This seems logical because in ordinary environment, the wild type of virus should be the strongest one. Any mutation of it is to fight back the drug, hence it is not the strongest one anymore\n\nThis is a misunderstanding of evolution. The wild type of a species is not the fittest this organism can be. That it is the wild type just means that it evolved and spread. Something that doesn't evolve can't spread (as an hyperbolic example, it might be advantageous for humans to have wings, but since we didn't evolve it, our wild type doesn't include it). \n\nIt also helps to remember that \"the wild type\" is not a uniform thing. There are many genetic variations which we still consider to be the wild type. Even bacteria that reproduce through asexual reproduction are not all the same, even within one host. \n\nIn the natural environment of the bacteria you are talking about, an antibiotic resistance confers little benefit because they don't encounter it. So if it evolves, it won't help these organisms survive and would only spread throughout the population by chance. On the contrary, it might even confer a disadvantage - for example, penicillin resistance required producing the protein beta-lactamase. In a penicillin free environment, this might just be a costly extra without a benefit. Over time, it might get lost. \n\nIn a human taking antibiotics, however, these bacteria with an antibiotic resistance are indeed fitter and have a survival advantage. Bacteria with multiple resistances even more so. Between bacteria, these resistances can actually be transferred by something called \"transformation\" that involves actually picking up genetic material, so evolving multiple resistances also isn't as uncommon as it may seem. \n\nAs for your virus example, without knowing more, I'd guess that the fitness reduction in the more resistant virus strain is probably a side effect of the resistance. Getting more or less fit through evolving resistance to treatment is not, in itself, a difference between viruses and bacteria. \n\n[Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance][1]\n\n[Mechanisms of Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics][2]\n\n[What is fitness?][4]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937522/\n  [2]: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspxhttp://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=151&page=886\n  [3]: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40221/bacteria-resistance-to-natural-antibiotics\n  [4]: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_27", "3677": "The only consequence is that meat from older animals is generally tougher.

Legal complaints are usually phrased as medical malpractice due to negligence or due to lack of an informed consent, which is recommended, but not mandatory (1, 2). \n\nWhat physicians can do to protect themselves from liability is take care that their off label prescribing is (2):\n\n> 1. made with the \npatient\u2019s knowledge that a drug is being \nprescribed for an off-label use; \n\n> 2. principally motivated by a desire to diagnose, \ntreat and directly benefit the patient for whom a drug is prescribed; \n\n> 3. based on the doctor\u2019s own expert medical opinion; \n\n> 4. supported by reputable peer reviewed literature reflecting sound scientific evidence; \n\n> 5. generally supported by the opinions of the physician\u2019s local colleagues\n\n\nThe situation is, however, different with the industry - promotion of off label use of medicines is prohibited. FDA has issued a draft document on it's viewpoint on industry providing information about off label use of their medicines. The request for information must be unsolicited (i.e. the company or its permanent or temporary employees should not prompt these requirements), and whether the request is public or not, the information should be provided in one-on-one communication (5). Furthermore, this document states:\n\n> *FDA has long taken the position that firms can respond to unsolicited requests for information about FDA-regulated medical products by providing truthful, balanced, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific or medical information that is responsive to the specific request, even if responding to the request requires a firm to provide information on unapproved or uncleared indications or conditions of use.*\n\n_______________________\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

All of these have their advantages and disadvantages, and many are still not routinely used. The important thing to have in mind is that, in blood, substances are bound to plasma proteins to some extent, and only the free (unbound) fraction can pass into saliva, so the concentration in saliva is proportional to the concentration of free substance in blood. \n\nLet's have a look at some possible applications:\n\nPharmacokinetic studies\n----\n\nMonitoring the concentrations of certain medicines can be useful, and saliva is a good material for monitoring neutral substances, weak acids or weak bases. Saliva is often used in [therapeutic drug monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_drug_monitoring), metabolic phenotyping (determination of activity of metabolic enzymes in a patient), compliance monitoring and determining the free fraction of the medicine. These are all used in highly individalised approaches to treatment, and are not routinely used.\n\nDiagnostic applications\n----\n\nThese can be found if you visit the websites of some laboratories that do these tests, and see what they offer. Some of those that I have found include:\n\n- steroid hormone testing (this is by far the most common one I found)\n- peptide hormone testing\n- antibody testing (for some infectious diseases, HIV e.g, and possibly allergies)\n- there is a commercially available nitric saliva test\n\n(by testing I mean - detecting presence and determining the concentration).\n\nThis procedure is definitely non-invasive, and as such it can be very convenient when multiple samples have to be drawn at certain time periods. This is often the case with steroid hormones, and this is why saliva can be preferred to blood - sampling saliva is less invasive than venipuncture. \n\nOn the other hand there are some analytical limitations: saliva is a complex matrix and some substances in it interfere with analysis; the concentration of tested substances is usually low in saliva, so method sensitivity is an issue. These sensitive methods are often advanced and sophisticated, and may be quite costly.  \n\nThere are other options which are being used or studied (some are successful and entering diagnostic use, some require further research):\n\n- Markers for systemic malignancies \n- Biomarkers for oral diseases\n- Biomarkers for some autoimmune diseases\n- Forensic analysis samples\n- Illicit drugs and their metabolites\n\nI take it that your question was out of curiosity. Clinical applications of these tests, whether they are necessary and cost-effective, and other clinical justification issues are up to a physician to determine in each individual case.\n\n________________\nAn interesting aside:\n\nThere are several collection methods. In some you don't actually have to spit into a tube - you chew a special swab and place it into a tube, and the saliva is obtained by centrifugation.

However, there have been studies that suggest that wisdom may not be entirely correct.\n\nFor example, [Genuis et al.][1] found that some toxic elements were preferentially excreted in sweat, including elements that were not found in blood serum. That suggests those elements are bound in tissues and therefore not readily removed by the liver and kidneys. \n\nThey conclude that:\n\n> Sweat analysis should be considered as an additional method for\n> monitoring bioaccumulation of toxic elements in humans.\n\nNote that they do **not** conclude that sweating plays a significant role in toxin elimination. \n\nNote also that the sample size in this study was very small, and the author has numerous publications based on this single study.\n\nA [literature review][2] of the subject found support for the idea that certain toxins are excreted in sweat, sometimes in higher concentrations than urine. They also noted as Genuis did that concentrations of some elements can be found in sweat that aren't detected in plasma.\n\n> In individuals with higher exposure or body burden, sweat generally\n> exceeded plasma or urine concentrations, and dermal could match or\n> surpass urinary daily excretion.

Cadmium was more concentrated in sweat than in blood plasma.\n\nWhat I cannot find is research showing that sweating produces any clinically significant benefit. Just because a compound can be found in sweat does not necessarily mean that sweating more will have a beneficial effect, and in fact no benefit to excessive sweating is known while there are known negative consequences, including potentially lethal ones.\n\nI conclude from my research that the question can't be answered at this time, but there is sufficient evidence to justify additional research. I suspect that the most likely outcome will be new and/or improved testing methods rather than treatment methods.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213291\n  [2]: http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2012/184745/\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22717638", "1066": "This rumor is common enough that there is even a [Snopes article][2] about it.\n\nIn essence no, this doesn't help, and is in fact closer to the opposite of the truth.  When eating a meal many more digestive enzymes and processes are started up then when only eating a small amount or say a pill.  This is one of the reason you should always take your multivitamin with or immediately after a meal.  The key factor here is known as gastric emptying, or how quickly the food is going through you.  [When it happens quickly][1], only the nutrients that are easy to absorb (like fats) are obtained.  Eating more food at once (to a point) slows gastric emptying allowing for more complete digestion.\n\nThere are two key aspects when looking at the digestion of fruit.  The first, and perhaps obvious, benefit is the absorption of nutrients.  All of the calories, vitamins, etc that one can get out of fruit falls into this category.  The second benefit is that of fiber which can help clear the gut of waste, bowel motility, maintenance of gut flora, and other uses that call for both soluble and non-soluble fibers which fruits are rich in.  A very good review on their benefit can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649719/).\n\nBut what about when they are mixed together with other things?  [When compared][3] to milk and oatmeal, blue berries were found to have a synergistic effect with oatmeal, but milk was found to be inhibitory to both.  If you are willing to take [an example with pigs][4], fruits and vegetables protected against some of the more harmful effects of a high fat and protein diet when eaten at the same time (though this could be because of simple decreases in the fat intake).\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18577009\n  [2]: http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/fruit.asp\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23944181\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029433", "986": "The so-called halos are typical for spikes of intraocular pressure rise in high-tension glaucoma (or ocular hypertension) forms, most often in [melanin-dispersion syndrome (MDS, or pigment-dispersion syndrome)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9071.2009.01920.x/full) which is a trigger for glaucoma in myopes and often begins in early adulthood. \n\n\nThe halos appear when a spike in intraocular pressure leads to [intracorneal edema](http://www.eyecalcs.com/DWAN/pages/v4/v4c016a.html), as the corneal endothelial cells which permanently pump the nutritious water out of the cornea cannot compete with the high pressure pushing the fluid into the cornea anymore. Thus, the cornea fills with water, leading to temporary loss of visual acuity and, as an early symptom, to halos and rainbows around sources of light due to increased dispersion of light. The regularity of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for corneal transparency, is disturbed by the intrusion of water leading to cell displacement.\n\nBasically, this can happen in other forms of high-tension glaucoma or ocular hypertension with momentarily raised intraocular pressure (IOP), too. Note that it only does in forms where the IOP rises quickly, whereas in a slow and constant rise (as it happens in many forms of chronic glaucoma) the endothelial cells can adapt and still drain the cornea from the excess water. So basically, the same happens in an attack of angle-closure glaucoma, just with the difference being that angle-closure glaucomas often don't go away without medical treatment, whereas in early adulthood IOP spikes due to MDS the halos often are the only symptom which is often triggered by exercise or in dim ambience light situations. This is due to the fact that when the iris moves (as in widened pupils due to adrenaline reactions when performing sports or whe the lights are dim) in a patient with MDS, it rubs against the lens, loses pigment by erosion and this then [clogs the eye's drain](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/8527032_Intraocular_pressure_spike_after_YAG_iridotomy_in_patients_with_pigment_dispersion) (in the anterior chamber angle).\n\nThis can be seen as basic knowledge in ophthalmology. A first report on the mechanism leading to IOP rise dates [back to 1953](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002939453907995). The induction of IOP spikes by exercise has also [been known for a longer period of time](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002939480900732).\n\nEDIT: As your question explicitly relates to open-angle glaucoma, I'd like to add that there are different types of open-angle glaucoma, and only some of them are known for IOP spikes that could lead to said halos and rainbows. Primary open-angle glaucoma usually doesn't, but other than the mentioned pigmentaray dispension syndrome, [PEX glaucoma](https://books.google.de/books?id=JZ9Gs3fLqrcC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=pex+glaucoma+spikes&source=bl&ots=xeLL-Xtl0G&sig=4bl_Gz93-chlsUZcwbQwbhoPFT0&hl=de&sa=X&ei=cfBZVfPHH8GNsgGkl4CACQ&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIs8SA6bnLxQIVwYYsCh2kCwCQ#v=onepage&q=pex%20glaucoma%20spikes&f=false) could, and [herpes simplex trabeculitis](http://www.oic.it/~egsmadrid2010/pdf/ps3b/P3.148.pdf) is also not uncommon.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology has a [good description on pigmentary glaucoma](http://eyewiki.aao.org/Pigmentary_glaucoma_and_Pigment_Dispersion_Syndrome) in their EyeWiki.\n\nIt can be also found in *Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 7th Edition.

R. Mayer. The Mayer quote shows an early use of the definition that comes up in nutrition classes. \n\n\"When substances endowed with considerable chemical affinity for each other combine chemically, much heat is developed during the process. We shall estimate the quantity of heat thus set free by the number of kilogrammes of water which it would heat 1\u00b0C. The quantity of heat necessary to raise 1 kilogramme of water 1 degree is called a unit of heat, Calorie. \"\n\nA calorie itself is not something you ingest, and there's no Dietary Reference Intake https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx for it, unlike everything else on the nutrition facts label (maybe that's why it's in separate box). \n\nIt's a measure of energy generation, so it depends on the individual process of how it's generated, and I'm not sure if the FDA bases their label's numbers off of cellular metabolic data using digestive enzymes and gut flora, they might use something like a butane torch. It might be a good idea to take the calorie number as a reference point when considering your own metabolism, and not as an exact quantity. Many things can affect someone's metabolism, its efficiency and its rate, at cellular and molecular levels (and above and below probably).\n\nIf you're thinking in terms of this definition, anything that causes metabolic reaction that generates heat could be measured as a calorie. Ethanol burns in a lab, but whether or not it generates heat in your body when it's metabolized depends on its metabolic processes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_metabolism . \n\nIf you wanted to know what substances generate heat in the body in general, the answer might be in the field of bioenergetics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics , but that would include cellular respiration as well as enzymatic processes as the wiki article says, so breathing and processing anything (including your own dead cells thru apoptosis, or any drug you take or xenobiotic substance that enters your body https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644612000359) could be shown to have a caloric value. Nutritionists and food producers are mostly focused on the calories from catabolic metabolism http://www.cte.sfasu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2_Principles_of_Digestion_and_Metabolism.html by specifically liver enzymes, of something absorbed through the intestines (different parts of the intestines absorb different things, and not all gets processed catabolically). \n\nThe food/nutrition industries' use of \"calories\" is a weirdly specific definition that presents a narrow view of bioenergetics -- bodies are way more complex and unique!", "23040": "In the long term, aortic stenosis (AS), especially when untreated, can cause structural changes to the heart that can contribute to arrhythmia. \n\nMore specifically, left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction caused by AS can cause pressure buildup in the LV, which over time can cause LV concentric hypertrophy (I.e., the heart muscle thickens uniformly). Such thickening of the heart can lead to a disruption of normal cardiac electrical activity and can lead to ventricular arrhythmias. An example of a study supporting this in a clinical population is Wolfe et al. 1993 in *Circulation* (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8425327).\n\nIn a genetic condition somewhat similar to aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, individuals are predisposed to ventricular arrhythmias in a similar fashion, which is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in these individuals (https://europepmc.org/article/med/1728506).\n\nIt is also possible that long-term untreated AS can lead to a backup of pressure into the left atrium, leading to left atrial enlargement, which can cause atrial fibrillation (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002914915018457).", "22929": "This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it's often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I'm guessing it's what you mean by \"chest infection\"). For some [background](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024012/) on causes of pneumonia:\n\n> Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.\n>\n> There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18\u201322). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...]\n>\n> A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24\u201328). The most common examples of these are *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Staphylococcus aureus*. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...]\n>\n> The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. **In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia** (9, 26, 39\u201356).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39\u201359). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. \n>\n> To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. **It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria** (60, 61). **IAV/*S. pneumoniae* coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung** (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63\u201366). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68).\n\nSo the NICE (i.e. UK) [guidelines](https://www.guidelinesinpractice.co.uk/infection/key-learning-points-nice-community-acquired-pneumonia/455067.article) for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:\n\n> Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, **viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people**. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, followed by *Haemophilus influenzae*; epidemics of *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children.\n>\n> Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]\n\nSo if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.\n\n> NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...]\n>\n> **An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia,** and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.\n\nAlso worth quoting from those guidelines:\n\n> In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.\n>\n> **Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment,** or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.\n\nBasically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won't get a test to determine the agent that caused it, *unless* the first course antibiotic doesn't resolve it.\n\nI can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can't be bothered to search them now.)\n\n[Short coda](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/antibiotic-resistance-could-lead-to-more-covid-19-deaths/) on Covid-19:\n\n>  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors.

The right side (on the left of the image) receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side (on the right of the image) receives blood back from the lungs and pumps it to the body.\n\nCardiac physiology\n------------------\n\nBlood entering the heart first enters an atrium. This contracts to fill the ventricle (the main chamber), which then contracts to expel blood from the heart. This cycle is divided into two main parts: **diastole** (when the atrium contracts and the ventricle is relaxed and filling) and **systole** (when the ventricle contracts).\n\nLeft ventricular systolic pressure must exceed the aortic diastolic pressure for blood to be ejected from the ventricle.\n\nBlood pressure\n--------------\n\nThe **cardiac output** (CO - measured in litres per minute) depends on the stroke volume (SV - blood pumped with each cardiac cycle) multiplied by the heart rate (HR).\n\n**Systemic vascular resistance** (SVR - often also called total peripheral resistance) is equal to the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) divided by the cardiac output. CVP is usually close to zero, so this is often shortened to:\n\n[![Equation for SVR][2]][2]\n\n**Blood pressure** (BP) is a measure of the force being exerted on the walls of arteries as blood is pumped out of the heart.\u00a0It is proportional to cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). It is usually expressed as the systolic blood pressure over the diastolic blood pressure.\n\nImportantly, with regard to your question, while peripheral systolic blood pressure is largely due to ventricular contraction in the heart, diastolic pressure in peripheral arteries is due to the walls of the arteries contracting passively after having been expanded during the pressure wave of systole. \n\nThis diagram shows the atrial, ventricular and aortic pressures during the cardiac cycle.\n\n[![Cardiac cycle][3]][3]\n\nThis is a pressure volume loop showing the relationship of ventricular pressure and volume during a single cardiac cycle.\n\n[![Pressure volume loop][4]][4]\n\nYou can see from both of these images that there is a point in early diastole where left ventricular pressure drops close to zero, before rising slowly. Later in diastole, the pressure rises gradually and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is commonly measured as a metric of cardiac performance. \n\nWhy the low left ventricular diastolic pressure?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis low diastolic ventricular pressure is primarily because a well-functioning ventricle will now be isolated from the systemic circulation by the closed aortic valve. In addition, it will have expelled a significant amount of the blood contained within (a normal **ejection fraction** (EF) is 55-70%), it is now relaxing and expanding in size and it has not yet received much blood from the atrium.\n\nIn heart failure with a impaired systolic function, the ejection fraction (EF) drops, but there is a phenomenon of diastolic dysfunction, where the EF is normal and the problem is impaired relaxation and compliance of the left ventricle. This is commonly linked to hypertension, as displayed in [this paper][5].\n\nThis pressure volume loop (in red) demonstrates this effect in diastolic dysfunction. ESPVR / EDPVR = end systolic / diastolic pressure volume relationship (a gradient of the graph or first derivative of pressure with respect to volume).\n\n[![Diastolic dysfunction PV graph][6]][6]\n\nAlso, there is [evidence][7] of a link between a higher LVEDP and increased mortality when measured during coronary angiography for acute myocardial infarction.\n\n***\n\nIn summary, the left ventricular diastolic pressure being low is normal and several factors are responsible for that. It is higher where there is ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\n***\n\n**Sources**:\n\n[Source for images][8]\n\n[CV Physiology][9]\n\n[Planer et al][10]\n\n[Lelande and Johnson][5]\n\n[Bagai et al][7]\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxyCq.jpg\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8dsmTt.jpg\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NI9Ne.gif\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/oxlwm.gif\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713868/\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnjU1.png\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24176448/\n  [8]: http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/heart/exercises/MechPropHeart/lecture.html\n  [9]: https://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP021\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21798494/?i=4&from=/17673873/related", "20319": "The differential diagnosis of a unilateral shoulder pain associated with computer work:\n\n - **Mouse shoulder** due to inappropriate arm position during working with a computer mouse ([CCOHS][1], [Acta Inform Med][2])\n - **Myofascial pain syndrome:** muscle pain associated with a forced posture, repeated movements and stress ([Mayo Clinic][3], [Indian J Anesth][4])\n - **Pinched nerve in the neck (cervical radiculopathy):** compression of the nerve that goes from the cervical spinal cord to an arm and may or may not be associated with the pain and tingling in the other parts of the arm and neck ([AAFP][5])\n - **Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis):** an inflammation of the capsule of the shoulder joint; risk factors include shoulder immobilization, diabetes, thyroid disease, etc. ([BMJ][6], [OrthoInfo][7])\n\nOther conditions mentioned in the question (rotator cuff syndrome, fracture, dislocation, arthritis, bursitis and tendinitis) are not specifically associated with computer work but with excessive physical work or other causes.\n\n  [1]: https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/mouse/mouse_problems.html\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4272839/\n  [3]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myofascial-pain-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20375444\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900090/\n  [5]: https://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0101/p33.html\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4225262/\n  [7]: https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/frozen-shoulder", "20304": "Low immunity with frequent infections in adults *without any [genetic immunodeficiency disease][1]* can be due to:\n\n - Genetic predisposition ([Cureus][2])\n - Old age ([J Clin Invest][3])\n - Excessive stress ([Psychol Bull][4])\n - Smoking ([Oncotarget][5])\n - Excessive alcohol drinking ([Alcohol Research][6])\n - Chronic conditions, such as malnutrition, low stomach acid, diabetes, kidney or liver disease, anemia, connective tissue disease, AIDS, cancer, etc. and anatomical abnormalities in the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract ([ArupConsult][7])\n - Long term treatment with medications, such as steroids ([CDC.gov][8])\n\n*If suspected,* chronic conditions need to be ruled out by relevant blood tests (complete blood count, vitamins, minerals, glucose, protein, liver panel, kidney tests, tumor markers), endoscopy, chest X-ray, etc.\n\nAccording to [Overview of Immune Assessment Tests, Military Strategies for Sustainment of Nutrition and Immune Function in the Field (NCBI Bookshelf, 1999)][9], the basic **blood tests** to evaluate immune status include:\n\n - **Complete blood count** (white and red blood cells and platelets), and specifically, lymphocytes and neutrophils \n - **C-reactive protein (CRP),** a marker of inflammation\n - Immunoglobulins **IgG** and **IgM,** indicators of immune status in the blood and other body fluids\n - Immunoglobulin **IgA,** an indicator of immune status of the secretions of the lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.\n\nLow levels of the mentioned markers speak for low immunity.\n\nHere's an example of a comprehensive [diagnostic algorithm to check immune status in adults][7].\n\nI strongly suggest everyone who wants to check his/her immune status to ask a specialist - **a conventional immunologist** - who can judge which tests to do and properly explain them.

This reduces the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, allowing the lost skin colour to return.\n>\nIn the less common segmental form of vitiligo, the affected skin lies in a dermatome, which is a particular area of skin supplied by a single nerve, so it usually affects only one side of the body.\n>\nSegmental and non-segmental vitiligo can also co-exist, giving rise to \u2018mixed\u2019 vitiligo.\n>\nThis study aimed to see whether the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite which occurs in nonsegmental vitiligo also occurs in segmental vitiligo, and if so, if the light activated pseudocatalase could also be of use in segmental vitiligo.\n\nThe bottom line is that, as far as I have seen, it has not been proven whether the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide is the cause of grey hair or not.\n\n##References\n\nNHS (2013). *No evidence of cure to prevent hair going grey*.

Following these changes in protein structure and function and lipid quantity, the compromised barrier is predisposed to irritation and infection, which leads to an abnormal immunological response as Th2 cells work to resolve inflammatory processes in the skin (it's not clear how B cells participate in the pathogenesis of eczema at this time). \n\nTreatment options for mild-moderate eczema are generally limited to topical corticosteroids and moisturizing ointments, as well as topical immunomodulators. For more severe disease, patients can pursue phototherapy, oral (and other systemic) immunosuppressants, or, recently, the mAb dupilumab, which targets the Th2-regulated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Considering this mAb's efficacy, you might regard eczema as an autoimmune disease with non-immunological predisposing factors.\n\n\n---\n\nGenerally speaking, all of the mechanisms you've described participate in the pathogenesis of eczema. As mentioned, atopic dermatitis (eczema) is not completely understood, but a number of factors have been identified as potential targets for clinical interventions. It remains unclear whether eczema is initiated at the skin barrier (\"outside-in\") or by the immune system (\"inside-out\"), as quality evidence supports either hypothesis, but the actual etiology of eczema is likely a complex interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic physiological elements. Collectively, these factors culminate to produce chronic pruritic (itchy) skin inflammation, particularly on flexor surfaces (\"creases\" between joints).\n\n>1. If the cause is a deficiency of ceramide, what causes this cause? \n\nCeramide is an interesting subject in the context of eczema. There are 12 ceramide subspecies, the quantities of which are important for the organization of the epidermal barrier. We know that the epidermal barrier is compromised in eczema, and we know that relative ceramide concentrations are different on eczema patients' skin compared to healthy controls, so we say that there is an *association* between altered ceramide production and eczema, although we're not certain that this 'deficiency' of ceramide is the actual cause of eczema [[1]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cod.12073).\n\n>Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules, so exactly which chemical is produced? \n\nFrom [1]: `The lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum consist predominantly of three different lipids: ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. The ceramides are further divided into 12 subspecies (ceramides 1\u201312), and are thought to be critical in the organization of the lipid bilayer. The synthesis of the lipids takes place in the stratum granulosum, from where the lipids are delivered to the stratum corneum. The lipids surround the corneocytes, which are flat nucleus\u2010free cells built of keratin filaments and surrounded by cross\u2010linked proteins called the cornified envelope.`\n\n>Is it because the skin produces another kind of ceramide which has lower quality, or it does not produce enough?\n\nFrom [1]: `Comparisons of SC ceramides in healthy skin and atopic dermatitis skin were made by different groups in the 1990s, and showed lower levels of ceramides 1 and 3, as well as a lower ceramide/cholesterol ratio, for non\u2010lesional atopic skin.`\n\n>2. If the cause is an abnormal or missing protein, what causes this cause?\n\nThe \"key players\" in skin barrier integrity are lipids (like ceramide) and proteins (which are regulated by gene expression). Because of this known relationship, it was long-hypothesized that there was some genetic dysregulation contributing to the compromised barrier integrity in eczema, which was supported by twin studies showing that eczema was highly heritable. In 2006, mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) were identified as a primary predisposing factor for eczema [[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1767),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16815158)].\n\n> What protein it is?\n\nFrom [2]: `Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier.`\n\nAs it relates to ceramide, from [1]: `...one research group studied atopic dermatitis skin, excluding patients with filaggrin mutations to ensure that the discoveries made were independent of the mutations, and correlated the ceramide composition with the lamellar lipid organization. They found significantly lower levels of ceramide 3 in atopic dermatitis individuals than in healthy controls, as well as a correlation between a low ceramide 3 level and lamellar lipid disorganization, despite the presence of wild\u2010type filaggrin in both groups.`\n\nWe can see from these results that both proteins (filaggrin) and lipids (ceramide) are involved in the pathogenesis of eczema, but they don't appear to be significantly related to one another. **It's possible that eczema/atopic dermatitis, as we currently understand it, can actually be broken up into many subphenotypes that have similar presentations (itchy, erythematous skin) but different etiologies, much like cancer and sepsis.**\n\n> Is that something related to T cells (recognizing antigens) or B cells (producing antibodies)? \n\nAs mentioned above, skin cells (not T cells) are responsible for lipid production, and filaggrin \"facilitates terminal differentiation of the epidermis\" (not lymphocyte development). However, T lymphocytes *are* involved in eczema, as it is an inflammatory process (which are regulated by these immune cells) [[4](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/154935)]. To avoid going down too many rabbit holes, you might familiarize yourself with [helper T cells and cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell) before continuing. From [4]: `...a subgroup of patients with atopic dermatitis has a filaggrin loss-of-function mutation. Recently, it was shown that filaggrin expression is reduced in atopic dermatitis even in the absence of any mutation. Keratinocytes differentiated in the presence of IL- 4 and IL-13 exhibited significantly reduced filaggrin gene expression and neutralization of IL-4 and IL-13 improves skin barrier integrity. This indicates that Th-2 lymphocytes directly contribute to the skin barrier defect in atopic dermatitis...Microscopic studies revealed a sparse perivascular T cell infiltrate in unaffected atopic dermatitis skin that is not seen in normal healthy skin.`\n\nIn terms of B cells, conflicting evidence exists regarding their participation in eczema's pathogenesis. Some patients have shown dramatic improvement in their symptoms when treated with rituximab, an anti-B cell mAb [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674907022531)], while others have not responded to the medication [[6](https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ced.12691)], marking the need for a formal RCT examining rituximab's efficacy in treating eczema and further studies elucidating the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n> Is it a skin problem or an immune system problem?\n\nThis is really asking \"is eczema an outside-in or an inside-out problem?\" The answer, as I'm sure you've already realized, is: it's more complicated than that. The \"problem\" of eczema arises from disrupted skin permeability, which can be both caused and worsened by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923181106001733)]:\n\n[![Fig.6-Proksch2006][11]][11]\n\n\n> 3. Also, I heard from many sources that this is an immune system problem. And the source of this problem is the gut. They quote Hippocrates: \"All disease begins in the gut\". Is that true? \n\nIt's true that studies have shown an association between reduced gut microbial diversity in early life and eczema, but best evidence doesn't support that the gut microbiome plays a definitively causative part in the pathogenesis of the disease [[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjd.14907)].\n\nFrom [8]: `Culture-based studies have shown strong associations between cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus colonisation and established atopic eczema during and outside of the context of disease flares. Using the same approach, there is also evidence for an inverse relationship between gut bacterial diversity in early life and the later development of atopic eczema, in keeping with the \u2018biodiversity hypothesis\u2019...both Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis proliferate whilst bacterial diversity drops at lesional sites when atopic eczema flares, but S. aureus elimination is not the main reason why atopic eczema gets better...studies have not found evidence that S. aureus colonisation triggers atopic eczema development...`\n\nBecause eczema is an inflammatory disorder, the immune system is an inherent participant in its initiation and resolution. Recent research has identified Th2 cells as important players in the pathogenesis of eczema [[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/exd.13336)]. From [9]: `Early models of aetiology attributed symptoms of [eczema] to cutaneous inflammation at lesion sites, but recent studies have established that activated immune mediators in the circulation drive disease severity. Activation of T helper 2 (Th2) and Th22 cells in the circulation appears to be the principal initiator of acute [eczema] pathology, with the emergence of Th1 and Th17/interleukin (IL)\u201023 pathway activation marking the transition to a chronic state.`\n\n\n> Will just eating healthy food, adding more probiotics, and applying moisturizer help the skin effectively?\n\n\"Healthy food\" *won't necessarily* help, but avoiding food that contains allergens that trigger your eczema outbreaks *will*. Besides, eating healthier will make you feel better in general. \"More probiotics\" almost certainly *won't* help, as clarified by [8]: `...there is further evidence that a reduced diversity of the faecal microbiota precedes the development of atopic eczema, an association that appears lost in established disease.` If \"established disease\" doesn't feature the same reduced diversity in the fecal microbiome as before the development of eczema, then the microbiome in established disease isn't really a therapeutic target. \n\n\"Applying moisturizer\" *probably will* help. From [7]: `Application of creams and ointments containing lipids and lipid-like substances, hydrocarbons, fatty acids, cholesterol esters and triglycerides stimulates barrier repair and increases stratum corneum hydration...As AD is often accompanied by reduced lipid composition, topical application of lipids and hydrocarbons may partially correct permeability barrier defects. It has been shown that topical treatment with hydrocortisone ointments may lead to rapid improvement in barrier function in atopic skin...several research groups and companies report that creams containing ceramides and a mixture of the three key lipids are not superior to \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 cream or ointment preparations, such preparations have not yet been widely used. More research is necessary to determine the significance of ceramides and the treatment composition with the most therapeutic benefit.`\n\nThe pathogenesis of eczema is multifactorial, but broadly follows a process of genetic (or epigenetic, in the case of the early gut microbiome) dysregulation relating to barrier integrity proteins like filaggrin with corresponding changes in the skin microenvironment's ceramide content. Following these changes in protein structure and function and lipid quantity, the compromised barrier is predisposed to irritation and infection, which leads to an abnormal immunological response as Th2 cells work to resolve inflammatory processes in the skin (it's not clear how B cells participate in the pathogenesis of eczema at this time). \n\nTreatment options for mild-moderate eczema are generally limited to topical corticosteroids and moisturizing ointments, as well as topical immunomodulators. For more severe disease, patients can pursue phototherapy, oral (and other systemic) immunosuppressants, or, recently, the mAb dupilumab, which targets the Th2-regulated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 [[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27690741)]. Considering this mAb's efficacy, you might regard eczema as an autoimmune disease with non-immunological predisposing factors.\n\n---\n\n[1] Jungersted, J. M. and Agner, T.

The study looked at safety (adverse event frequency) and influence on depression (HAM-D, CGI). One key point I would like to make is that the report states that symptoms of depression did subside;\n>Mean HAM-D scores decreased steadily from 20.58 at baseline to 12.07 at week 26 and to 11.18 at week 52.

In other countries St. John's wort is only available with a prescription.\n\nYet, St John's Wort is available in tablets over the counter here in the UK.\n\nThe NHS here in the UK points out that, \n>It should be noted that St. John\u2019s wort is an unlicensed herbal medication, so would not be prescribed by a general practitioner (as the newspapers suggest). St. John\u2019s wort can have serious interactions with a large number of commonly used medications (e.g. warfarin), by affecting enzymes in the body involved with the metabolic processing of drugs; therefore a discussion with a doctor is important. Additionally, St. John\u2019s wort must not be started while another antidepressant is being taken ([NHS, 2008][4]).\n\nWebMD also states\n>St. John's wort is\u00a0**POSSIBLY UNSAFE** when taken by mouth in large doses. When taken by mouth in large doses, it might cause severe skin reactions to sun exposure. Women may be at risk of severe skin reactions even at usual doses of St. John's wort. Wear sun block outside, especially if you are light-skinned.\n\n## St John's Wort and Major Depression\nThe NHS covers this too;\n>The findings [of a systematic review and meta-analysis] \u2013 that it is more effective than placebo and the same as standard antidepressants (albeit safer) - apply mainly to people with mild to moderate depression. The authors say that for severe major depression, the evidence is \u2018still insufficient to draw conclusions\u2019.\n\n## Long Term Use\n\nThe answer to your question\n>Are there any side effects or reduced efficiency of long term use of st Johns wort?\n\ndepends on what you call long term for one thing.\n\n[Brattstr\u00f6m (2009)][2] conducted the study over a 1 year period calling it long term.  If you are talking about longer than this, as St John's Wort only helps with mild to moderate depression, I would wonder about the efficacy of St John's Wort in your case.  Therefore, I would suggest seeking advice of your doctor again.\n\n**As long as you check with your doctor before taking it**, plus\n\n - you are not taking other medications which interact badly with St John's Wort, and\n - you are not suffering any side effects\n\nthen it is generally considered safe\u00a0(WebMD, 2017) but must be used with caution, in the same dosages prescribed by the doctor or indicated on the packaging.\n\n## References\n\nBrattstr\u00f6m, A.

Imagine two otherwise identical people (Alex and Bob) who have both consumed say 2000 calories. Alex spends the rest of the day after eating sitting on the couch enjoying old episodes of *Rick and Morty* on Netflix (Keep Summer safe!) whereas Bob went out and ran a marathon, helped their elderly neighbor move their living room furniture around (Bob's a good guy or \"sucker\" depending on your perspective!) and then cycled 5km to the shop for cat food. Now who's going to have more calories available for storing in body fat - Alex or Bob?\n\nThey've both consumed the same amount of calories but Bob has burned more of those off then Alex.\n\nNow you're no doubt thinking to yourself \"well that's obvious - but I've seen Charlie and Derek who *both* spent the afternoon watching Netflix but Charlie is obese and Derek is a stick insect, what gives?\"\n\nWell that's because the majority (~ 70%) of our calorie burning is actually done by the basic processes of keeping the body running. This is called the [Basal Metabolic Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) (BMR) and this varies between different individuals and while some of the [factors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280423) dictating this difference have been identified and understood we don't have a complete understanding of it yet.\n\nAdditionally not only are we humans not all the same - not all calories are either. Different foods might have the same numeric calorie values but depending on how they are made up (fats, sugars, carbohydrates etc) the body will digest and process them differently and this can effect body fat levels. A person eating a diet high in saturated fats will gain fat faster than someone eating the same amount of calories from [Low-GI sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22157060).\n\nSo just looking at the amount of calories people consume is insufficient to fully answer the question of why some people are obese and some aren't.", "18179": "The answer is very probably yes, these findings were confirmed and one *should* avoid consuming durian fruit and alcohol. But interestingly, anyone tempted to try *probably will* avoid it anyway. \n\nThe fruit contains \"components\" that interfere with alcholo metabolism, leading to increased toxicity and a quick learning experience. \n\n> A combination of consuming durian fruit and alcohol drinks is reported to lead adverse effects in humans (Maninang, Lizada, & Gemma, 2009). Earlier, Croft (1981) reported on patients consuming durian and drinking alcohol simultaneously, which included deaths as well as cardiac arrest episodes. The symptoms included clinical manifestations such as: palpitation, vomiting, facial flushing, nausea, and drowsiness. In addition, physiological effects of drinking alcohol might also have major contribution on health effects. According to Kitson and Weiner (1996), component derived from ethanol is oxidised in liver by the action of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme. Disulfiram can retard ALDH activity resulting in the accumulation of alcohol-derived acetaldehyde. According to some researchers (Brien & Loomis, 1985), acetaldehyde contributes to the adverse reactions known as the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER). The inhibitory activities of sulphur-containing compounds obtained from natural resources on ALDH are well known (Kitson & Weiner, 1996). Several studies have shown durian to be abundant in sulphur compounds (Baldry et al., 1972; Moser et al., 1980; Voon et al., 2007b; Weenen et al., 1996; Wong & Tie, 1995).\n\n> Sub-chronic and acute toxicity examinations (through oral feeding) in rats and mice fed diets containing polysaccharide gel isolated from durian rind showed no toxic effects (Pongsamart, Sukrong, & Tawatsin, 2001; Pongsamart, Tawatsin, & Sukrong, 2002). Maninang et al. (2009) evaluated the effects of durian fruit extract on the inhibition of ALDH. The enzymatic assay demonstrated that yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase (yALDH) significantly lost enzymatic activity in the presence of durian fruit extract at all the tested concentrations (0.03, 0.07, 0.16, 0.33, 0.65, and 1.63 ppm). The intensity of inhibition increased with increase in the fruit extract concentration and was up to a maximum of 70% at 0.33 ppm extract. However, the inhibitory effect was observed to be low at the highest concentration (1.63 ppm) of the tested fruit extract. The non-polar organic constituents of the durian fruit extract gave positive results in the sulphur-test elicited significant inhibitory effects on yALDH. In addition, several studies reported that the diethyl disulphide to be the most abundant sulphur com- pound which contains a disulphide bridge in durian (Laohakunjit, Kerdchoechuen, Matta, Silva, & Holmes, 2007; Voon et al., 2007a). As the sulphur content of durian is reported to have inhibitory characteristic on ALDH activity and can be mortal in person who consume durian and drink alcohol simultaneously, further in vivo studies are warranted to provide more scientific evidence for better understanding to the consumers.\n\n> Lee-Hoon Ho & Rajeev Bhat: \"Exploring the potential nutraceutical values of durian (Durio zibethinus L.) \u2013 An exotic tropical fruit\", Food Chemistry 168 (2015) 80\u201389. ([DOI][1])\n\nThe learning in vivo:\n\n> We hereby present empirical proof that concurrent administra- tion of ethanol and durian elicits DER-like interactions in vivo. Although work is currently undertaken to identify the bioactive component(s) in durian causing the ill interaction with ethanol, the clinical manifestations appear to be similar to those observed in rats given cabbage, a known source of the ALDH-inhibiting PEI- TC. Consistently, blood acetaldehyde levels were elevated in rats that exhibited CTA and hypothermia, which further supports the role of acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol, in the severity of the DER.\nEthanol is the most available psychoactive drug in many parts of the world. With advocacies on increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, and moderate alcohol drinking, the likelihood of unsafe food-alcohol interactions observed in the present study is not remote. These findings provide a basis for a caveat on the choice of food items that precede ethanol.\n\n> John S. Maninang et al.: \"The influence of durian (Durio zibethinus Murray cv.

We think the term \ninfraorbital ring-shaped melanosis\nproposed  by  Watanabe  et  al.  does  not  encompass  its\netiology in a global manner.\nAs  there  is  neither  a  general  understanding  about\ndark  circles  pathogenesis  nor  a  consensus  about  the\nmajor  responsible  features,  treatments  are  chosen  in  a\nsimplified  way,  rendering  suboptimal  results  most  of\nthe time. It is important to identify the specific anatomic\nproblem  of   each  patient  in  order  to  individualize  treatment.\n\nThis gets closer to a direct answer and offers several possible etiologies (**bolded**) for infraorbital hyperpigmentation. These are further clarified in the context of sleep by publications from this year:\n\n> [**\"A study of epidemiological, etiological, and clinicopathological factors in periocular hyperpigmentation.\"  M Chatterjee, B Suwal, A Malik, B V. *Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology.* 2018.**](http://www.pigmentinternational.com/article.asp?issn=2349-5847;year=2018;volume=5;issue=1;spage=34;epage=42;aulast=Chatterjee)\n\n> **Conclusion:**\nPeriocular darkening was predominantly not due to pigment, but rather due to cutaneous laxity and vascular visibility through\nthin skin. Most of them with pigment had it in the dermis. Clinical dermal pigmentation correlated well with histology, unlike epidermal\npigmentation. Iron and amyloid were not significant as etiological factors in our patients.\n\n\n> [**\"Periorbital hyperpigmentation \u2212 An overview of the enigmatous condition.\"  \nManju Daroach, Muthu S Kumaran. *Pigment International.* 2018.**](http://www.pigmentinternational.com/temp/PigmentInt511-8315215_230552.pdf)\n\n> Periocular dark circles may appear because of various\nanatomic factors such as architecture of facial ligaments,\nthe bony facial structure, midface soft tissue including the \nprominence of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Because of ageing,\nthere is a loss of facial fat leading to inflexible ligaments\ncausing hollowing effect on orbital rim. There is worsening of\nshadowing duetohollowness,which is mainly seen in the tear\ntrough area in inferomedial orbit. The thin eyelid skin\ncontributes to the prominence of the underlying soft tissue\nand subcutaneous vascular network and the orbicularis oculi\nmuscle, due to which the overlying skin appears dark. \n\n> Visible pigmentary changes in periorbital area may be due to\nextravasated hemoglobin and its breakdown products\nbilirubin and biliverdin. A variety of pathologic and\nage-related processes result in the increased permeability\nof the local vasculature resulting in these pigmentary\nchanges. The lower eyelid tissues may have an increased\ntendency to accumulate fluid due to local processes such as\natopy as well as systemic fluid retention and can be limited\ninferiorly by the orbital rim because of the cutaneous\nligaments. This fluid often takes on a purplish color due\nto the prominent role of the orbicularis muscle in the lower\neyelid. Medical disorders including disorders of liver,\nheart, thyroid or kidney, hereditary blood disorders,\nvitamin  K  deficiency.\n\nFor a more complete analysis of the different contributing factors to infraorbital dark circles, check out this review from 2016:\n\n> [**\"Infraorbital Dark Circles: A Review of the Pathogenesis, Evaluation and Treatment.\" Ivan Vrcek, Omar Ozgur, and Tanuj Nakra. *Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery.* 2016.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924417/)\n\n> Infraorbital dark circles are caused by a variety of anatomic features, with contributions from the skin, subcutaneous tissues, orbicularis muscle, vasculature and ligamentous architecture of the lower eyelid and cheek. A detailed understanding of the regional anatomy is crucial to the management of dark circles, which encompasses a wide variety of modalities.\n\n\n\n### This might not be a totally satisfying answer, but it's not as simple as a single source of pigmentation resulting in dark circles under the eyes. Even though there are many contributing factors, we still use general periorbital hyperpigmentation as an [identifier of fatigue](https://content.iospress.com/articles/integrated-computer-aided-engineering/ica00476), since the various factors (usually) cumulatively represent sleeplessness.", "17782": "Examples of conditions with fever and severe headache in which *inflammation is not involved or is not the main process:*\n\n - Caffeine overdose ([BMJ][1])\n - \"Thyroid storm\" - acute hyperthyropidism ([PubMed][3])\n - Hyperparathyroidism, for example, due to adenoma of parathyroid glands ([Annals.org][4])\n - Cancers and tumors, such as lymphoma, brain tumors, pituitary adenoma ([Cancer.net][5])\n \nExamples of *inflammatory* conditions with fever and severe headache:\n\n - Temporal arteritis ([WebMD][6])\n - Systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE ([WebMD][7])\n - Infectious mononucleosis ([WebMD][8])\n\nApart from a CT and lumbar puncture, diagnostic tests can include blood tests for thyroxine and parathyroid hormone levels, blood and other tests for the mentioned cancers and blood tests for vasculitis (arteritis).\n\n  [1]: http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2018-224185.full\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387892/\n  [4]: http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/693417/primary-hyperparathyroidism-presenting-fever-unknown-origin-unremitting-headache\n  [5]: https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/side-effects/headaches\n  [6]: https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis#1\n  [7]: https://resources.lupus.org/entry/nervous-system\n  [8]: https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/symptoms-of-mononucleosis", "17720": "As @DoctorWhom says, there is a great deal of variability in the effectiveness of single agents for blood pressure control. There are [some](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7755948) [subgroups](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29133354) of patients who are more likely to respond or not respond to certain drugs, though. In the U.S., Black Americans tend to be less likely to respond to ACE inhibitors (and more likely to respond to thiazide diuretics, though that wasn't a drug in the question), and this difference is incorporated into the guidelines for choosing initial monotherapy (a single drug). There is [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7755948) that older patients are also less likely to respond to ACE inhibitors, but this [isn't quite as clear cut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386598/). [Regional differences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10737282) may be more important than racial differences, suggesting the effect is mediated by environment and lifestyle, rather than genetics. \n\nFor a while, European guidelines recommended exactly the pattern described in the OP for older or non-white patients (avoid ACE-inhibitors, use calcium channel blockers), because these patients were often observed to have low renin hypertension (see @DoctorWhom's answer, ACE-inhibitors work by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, or RAA, axis, so a low renin hypertension wouldn't be improved with this therapy). [Updated European guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107724) no longer make that recommendation. Regardless (outside of disease related reasons for choosing or avoiding a specific drug class) the best approach is to find and stick with a drug or combination that [brings blood pressure to the desired target](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29133354).\n\nImportantly, for anyone who might be reading this and wondering why a particular combination of antihypertensive drugs were chosen in their case, these drugs are generally given to reduce the risk of vascular and heart disease (e.g., heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and others). They target a disease determinant, blood pressure. There are goals related to that determinant, but the primary goal is downstream of the elevated blood pressure. Because of this, there are sometimes reasons to choose a drug that is more effective at preventing the end point of concern for a particular individual. These reasons might not be explained to a patient. I wish we were better at this. Some medications provide nice immediate positive feedback when taken and some don't. I've often seen patients who were put on a beta-blocker after a heart attack stop taking it, and I have to explain that their cardiologist didn't put them on the beta blocker to help them feel better, but to keep them from dying.

(Ramkumar V et al, J Clin Invest 82:242-247) in a process known as [upregulation][2]\n\n\"A [1995 study suggests][3] that humans become tolerant to their daily dose of caffeine\u2014whether a single soda or a serious espresso habit\u2014somewhere between a week and 12 days. And that tolerance is pretty strong. One test of regular caffeine pill use had some participants getting an astronomical 900 milligrams  (9 cups of coffee) per day, others placebos\u2014found that the two groups were nearly identical in mood, energy, and alertness after 18 days.

(I realize this is not sufficient for many readers. I'm sorry.) If you've bitten your nails beyond the fingertip, the remaining skin will regrow into the space once occupied by the nails, thus filling in what was once the nailbed. If this has happened and you cease the habit, <i>the outside edges of</i> your nails will grow into that skin, becoming ingrown, <i>and the main, central portion of the nail will press down on that skin, thus causing some discomfort/pain</I>.

I actually just did a presentation on this, so this answer will probably have more information in it than you need, but I'll add it for completeness.\n\n**Fever as an Adaptive Response**\n\nThe first important thing to know about fever is that it is something your body initiates when you get certain types of infections. It is not a direct consequence of the bacteria or viruses themselves. [Instead, white blood cells release a chemical messenger called prostaglandin E2. This travels to the brain, where it causes the body to start ramping up its set point for temperature][1]-- essentially turning up the thermostat.\n\nThis is important because it seems to indicate an evolved response-- perhaps there is an evolutionary advantage to a fever in the setting of infection. [Many bacteria are very temperature sensitive][1], so this idea makes sense.\n\n**The Data**\n\nMany papers have been published on the effect of fever on infection-- here are just a few:\n\n - [Patients who don't take acetaminophen/ paracetamol clear the malaria parasite faster than those who control their fever][2]\n - [Heat-stressed rats are more resistant to a common bacterial toxin than rats with a normal body temperature][3]\n\nIn critically ill patients (my area of interest), there have been several interesting studies. In [this randomized controlled trial][4] (RCT) from 2005, they compared mortality in ICU patients where fevers were controlled with acetaminophen/ paracetamol and where fevers were not controlled. They actually had to stop the trial early because death rates in the group getting acetaminophen/ paracetamol were much higher.\n\n[This prospective study][5] (not randomized) from 2012 looked at over 1400 critically ill patients, and found that treating fever doubled the mortality rate.\n\n[This meta-analysis][6], which included 11 studies, found a \"trend towards higher mortality for aggressive treatment\" of fever, though their p-value (how likely it is their findings are due to chance) was 0.09, which is higher than the 0.05 that is traditionally used as the cutoff for statistical significance.\n\n**[The most high-powered meta-analysis done to date][7]**, which included 16 studies and a total of about 20,000 critically ill patients, found less dramatic results-- essentially concluding that it makes no difference if you treat a fever or not.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n\nMost of the studies done here are in critically ill patients, with mortality as the final endpoint. You can make a case that in those patients, you may be better off not treating fever, since you want to keep them alive.\n\n[The vast majority of fevers are due to respiratory viral illnesses][1]. These have low mortality rates, and so rather than trying to lower mortality, **you're trying to minimize the symptoms**. And it sucks to have a fever. So for most people who do not need to get admitted to the hospital, treating a fever is a tradeoff between potentially getting better faster (an UNPROVEN benefit, as far as I could find), and not having a fever.\n\nIf a person is willing to sweat it out with the hope that the disease will run its course faster, that's perfectly reasonable. And if they are ok with the disease taking a little longer to clear from the body as long as they aren't sweating, shaking, and burning up, that makes a lot of sense too.\n\nI should also note that there are times when a fever IS extremely dangerous-- if it's over about 106 it can lead to brain damage. All of the studies in humans treated fever if it went above about 104 degrees.\n\n**TL;DR:** You are onto something! There is a lot of data out there that supports the hypothesis that treating fever is bad for you (or at least not any different from doing nothing).\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944485/\n  [2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673697022551\n  [3]: http://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1992.73.4.1517\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16433601\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22373120\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0031168/\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28221185", "14927": "\nYes, smokers probably function with less oxygen, but is this really a bad thing?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy comments are strictly for the open minded!\n\nI am a 50 year old chronic cigarette smoker and my readings are usually in the range of 97 - 100 when my hands are warm. I have had readings of 100+ on a few occasions which I assume to be a fault of the machine!\n\nI think it is highly plausible that smokers have less oxygen running around the blood stream and as JohnP points out CO has very pointy elbows\nin a queue to get on the bus! But where I differ is that this is not neccessarily a bad thing! It could actually be theraputic for certain conditions where a there is less oxygen in the blood stream than is desirable. Take for example emphysema.\n\nIn [this study from the Australian Bureau of Statistics][1], where the study subjects were **picked at random from the general population** and asked to self report on their health and smoking status.It showed that never smokers have a higher percentage of pretty much all diseases (including cancers and hypertension etc) with the exception of bronchitis and emphysema which is consistent with a causal hypothesis for smoking. \n\nFor persons over the age of 45 the percentages are for bronchitis and emphysema:\n\n - smokers 7.8% \n - former  smokers 7.6% \n - never smokers 3.4%\n\nSo smokers have double the risk for bronchitis and emphysema compared to never smokers and although this risk is not as great as many figures that the anti-smoking industry alludes to , it is however a significantly larger risk. And as this study is **randomised** it is likely to be a fair\nreflection of reality. \n\nSee above figures in table below.\n\n[![Austrailian Bureau of Statistics: 1989-90 National Lifestyle and HealthAustrailia][2]][2]\n\n\nBoth smokers and former smokers have roughly double the rate of bronchitis and emphysema which is consistent with the hypothosis that\nsmoking caused these conditions through some unknown mechanism. But it could also be that smokers are choosing to smoke because they feel an immediate therapeutic effect from smoking. And stopping smoking did not significantly reduce the number of former smokers that got the disease (7.8% vs 7.6%) which suggests that smoking may not be causal and could be merely therapeutic. \n\nParacetamol has an immediate therapeutic effect for people but we don't just assume that it causes every disease known to human kind just because \npeople that use it have diseases. We know that it is an analgesic and people use it for pain relief. If tobacco were paracetamol, the anti-smoking industry could plausibly claim that it causes all known diseases but without supporting evidence it would be foolish to believe it.\n\nIf it is true that healthy smokers go about their day to day business with significantly less oxygen than their never smoking friends then this is another way of saying **smokers can function with less oxygen**. It is as if smokers are just permanently altitude training. When never smokers do their daily business at sea level smokers are doing the same but a few thousand feet further up. This is all quite rational I think.\n\nBut is there evidence that smoking has an immediate therapeutic effect for oxygen starved people?\n\nI can find anecdotal evidence from mountain climbers here is a quote from a Mount Everest expedition in 1922. [Source the Guardian][3]\n\n> Cigarettes as an aid to climbing Report, November 21 1922\n>\n>Captain GJ Finch, who took part in the Mount Everest expedition, speaking at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, London, last evening on the equipment for high climbing, testified to the comfort of cigarette smoking at very high altitude. He said that he and two other members of the expedition camped at 25,000ft for over 26 hours and all that time they used no oxygen.\n>\n>About half an hour after arrival he noticed in a very marked fashion that unless he kept his mind on the question of breathing, making it a voluntary process instead of an involuntary one, he suffered from lack of air. He had 30 cigarettes with him, and as a measure of desperation he lit one. After deeply inhaling the smoke he and his companions found **they could take their mind off the question of breathing altogether** ... The effect of a cigarette lasted at least three hours, and when the supply of cigarettes was exhausted they had recourse to oxygen, which enabled them to have their first sleep at this great altitude.\n\nTake this study of coal miners https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2523477 it could be that smoking contributed towards their condition but it is also equally rational that many smokers just felt an immediate therapeutic effect as our mountaineering friends said.\n\nThe important point here is not whether smoking helped them, our mountaineering friends, to cope with less oxygen, although it may well have done as they clearly thought it did, the point is that they felt it did, hence possibly explaining the roughly double risk for bronchitis and emphysema for smokers in the above study.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/D17F9B5EDB4DFC26CA257225000495E0/$File/43660_8990.pdf\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fuZA.png\n  [3]: https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/17/sportandleisure.sport", "14265": "Surprisingly: yes, heating honey can be of a certain concern.\n\nThe article linked to above is based on ayurvedic principles which do not compare well in their reasoning with modern scientific thinking:\n\n> [First, Ayurveda claims that heating honey to 104\u00b0F/ 40\u00b0C or above causes a negative chemical change that causes it to become bitter. This makes it undesirable to use from a culinary perspective in comparison with other natural sweeteners like unrefined cane sugar or fruit.<br><br>\nIn addition, Ayurvedic dietary principles warn that consuming honey that has been cooked, baked or added to hot liquids contributes to ill health over time. The reason is because honey that is cooked becomes like glue. The molecules then tend to adhere to mucous membranes in the digestive tract producing toxins, called ama. The literal meaning of ama is undigested food or toxins stuck within the digestive tract. It is considered to be the root cause of most ill health in Ayurveda with heated honey one of the most difficult forms to detoxify.<br><br>\nCharaka, the ancient sage of Ayurveda, wrote over 500 years ago that \u201cnothing is so troublesome as ama caused by the improper intake of honey.\u201d<br><br> \nDr. Krishna, an Ayurvedic practitioner for over two decades explains further that even raw honey should not be mixed with hot or spicy foods as this will by default make it \u201chot\u201d. In addition, he advises against using raw honey in a hot environment where you are already warm and possibly overheated.\nAt this point, we\u2019ve established that the ancient system of Ayurveda considers uncooked honey to be nectar and cooked honey as poison. But, what does modern science have to say on the subject?][1]\n\n<br>\n\nThat is indeed an interesting question. Some concepts in the above reasoning should be regarded as very weak reasoning. It could nevertheless be accidentally right, based on empirical evidence and just getting in wrong in the pre-scientific explanation? Meanwhile, the producers of honey, have a clear message:\n\n> [Is Heated Honey Toxic?][2]<br>\n> First, let\u2019s assuage the most serious concern \u2013 no, heating honey will not turn it toxic and kill you. Heating up raw honey will change the makeup of the honey, and potentially weaken or destroy enzymes, vitamins, minerals, etc (more on this in a second) but it will not give you a horrible disease or poison you. Yes, this is something that we\u2019re asked.\n>\n> Keeping it close to raw is great for your body, but heating it isn\u2019t going to kill you.\n\n<br>\n\nBut that heat denatures the enzymes present in honey and destroys some vitamins should not come at a surprise. Heated protein is consumed in large amounts and the protein coming from cooked eggs or fried meat is not a concern for [coctivores][3] like humans.\n\nWhat is the reason for valid concern then? A small degradation of enzymes and vitamins doesn't sound scary.\n\n\n[Studies on the physicochemical characteristics of heated honey, honey mixed with ghee and their food consumption pattern by rats][4]:\n\n> Honey and ghee are the two food substances used widely in our diet. In Ayurveda, it is quoted that heated honey and honey mixed with equal amount of ghee produce deleterious effects. [\u2026] There was a significant rise in hydroxymethyl furfuraldehyde (HMF) in 60\u00ba and 140\u00b0C heated honey samples. The browning and total antioxidant of honey mixed ghee samples was significantly higher when compared to ghee samples. [\u2026] The study revealed that the heated honey mixed with ghee produces HMF which may cause deleterious effects.\n\n\n<br>\n\n[Effects of honey HMF on enzyme activities and serum biochemical parameters of Wistar rats][5]:\n> Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a by-product of thermal degradation of glucose and fructose. In this study, the effects of high HMF content of honey on biochemical parameters of rats were investigated. Experiments were conducted with 40 Wistar albino male rats, each weighing 250-350 g and covered a period of 5 weeks. The animals were divided into five groups. The first group was served as control group. HMF was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 200 mg/kg rat b.w. to the animals in group 2. Group 3 was fed with honey that contains 10 mg HMF/kg honey. In group 4 and 5, there were honeys that contain significantly high HMF content due to long storage period (181 mg HMF/kg honey) and heat process (140 mg HMF/kg honey). At the end of the feeding process, biochemical blood parameters of rats were investigated. It was observed that there were no differences among the glucose, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, Na, GGT, and ALP parameters of the groups. On the other hand, significant differences were observed among the cholesterol, LDL, BUN, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, K, Cl, total bilirubin, LDH, CPK, AST, ALT, total protein, and pseudocholinesterase values of the rats. The highest adverse effects were obtained from group HMF, and it was followed by groups SH (stored honey) and HH (heated honey). It can be concluded that high HMF content of honey may affect the human health adversely; thus, HMF in honey must be controlled by beekeepers.\n\n<br>\n\nThat is indeed a bit disconcerting. [HMF][6] is present in honey from the start and increases with age as well as with the application of heat. This substance is [suspected][7] to be a carcinogenic agent. But how much of this substance actually forms in the intended application of honey as sweetener in tea?\n\n[Characterisation of viscosity, colour, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural content and diastase activity in raw rape honey (Brassica napus) at different temperatures][8]:\n> The effect of heating at various temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 \u00b0C) on dynamic viscosity, colour, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) concentration and diastase activity of raw rape honey were assessed. [\u2026] **Heating for 15 min between 50 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C did not significantly degrade the quality of the honey, but, *slightly* enhanced formation of 5-HMF and reduced the diastase activity.**\n\nHeating honey may not be ideal, and it *does* spoil a little over time. In relation to the question it has to be noted that all hexose [saccharides][9], and especially fructose as found in table sugar, can degrade in the same way.\n\nAll of this has to be put into perspective: a table spoon of honey in a cup of tea will not reach a high enough temperature for long enough to really become so [toxic in a meaningful dose][10] to be of any real concern in that regard.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/is-cooking-honey-unhealthy/\n  [2]: https://sleepingbearfarms.com/raw-honey-posts/heating-honey-pros-cons/\n  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7EccYugxhQ\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215355/\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439754\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxymethylfurfural\n  [7]: https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.lwt.2010.11.002\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27413239\n  [9]: https://dx.doi.org/10.1081%2Ffri-120025480\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison", "13510": "> **Please Note: This is not a diagnosis, it is being provided to help you and a health care professional understand possible causes of your\n> condition.

For individual diagnosis one must see a physician.  A primary care physician is a good option, as they can diagnose celiac disease, it is usually not necessary to see an immunologist or dermatologist.*\n\nDermatitis Herpetiformis [**does have a differential diagnosis.**][3]\n\nFirst, consider other conditions that could mimick DH like bullous pemphigoid, herpes, uritcaria, eczema, etc.\n\n - DH is often confirmed by a biopsy and testing for associated conditions that are suggested by other symptoms.\n\nEven for confirmed DH, however, consider that celiac is not the only disease associated with DH.  \n\n - [UpToDate][4] states that the next most common associated condition is autoimmune thyroid disease, and others include type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, vitiligo, Addison's disease, alopecia areata, some other autoimmune diseases, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nRemember that correlation does not imply causation - this means that just because they occur together does not mean one causes the other, or that they are certainly caused by the same thing.  It just means that there's an increased likelihood of having one of the other conditions.\n\n**However, the added time-consistent direct correlation of gluten and the rash would very *strongly suggest celiac* and make other associations unlikely.**\n\nSo, is it *diagnostic* of celiac disease then?  Can you definitively rule in or out celiac?\n\nNo.  \n\n1.  Diagnosing celiac disease incorporates multiple aspects including clinical history, exam, and usually lab testing.\n\n2. Consider that gluten does not exist in isolation; it is a component along with many other components in certain foods.  It is possible, though less likely, to have a skin reaction to a different component in the same food.\n\n[This article][1] in a GI Journal states the current recommendation:\n\n> ...interpretation of serological testing requires consideration of the full clinical scenario.\n\nI have seen some providers consider one feature of celiac disease as clinically diagnostic, and therefore treated as such without necessarily confirming with blood tests:  **the repeatable correlation of resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms on removal of gluten, and recurrence of symptoms upon reintroduction of gluten.**\n\nHowever, there are other associated recommendations are to do the blood testing to have a more concrete diagnosis.  [UpToDate][2] recommends:\n\n> As a general rule, testing should begin with serologic evaluation. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody is the single preferred test for detection of celiac disease in individuals over the age of two years.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3088693/\n  [2]: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults?source=machineLearning&search=celiac&selectedTitle=1~150&sectionRank=1&anchor=H3#H7\n  [3]: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1062640-differential\n  [4]: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatitis-herpetiformis?source=see_link&sectionName=ASSOCIATED%20DISEASES&anchor=H23341200#H23341200", "12003": "There are some small drawbacks associated with surgery, that all doctors are going to tell you. And there are some big drawbacks (like death or amputation risk), that not all doctors are going to tell you.\n\nFor instance, one of the greatest Brazilian female singers, Clara Nunes died some 30 years ago in one such operation, at the peak of her energy. Some people say this is old news, so here are more recent ones:\n\n[Woman dies after varicose veins surgery.][1]\n\n[Woman has her leg amputated after varicose veins surgery.][2]\n\n[Another woman dies because hospital failed to carry basic test.][3]\n\n[Yet another woman died due to a blood clot in the lung following vein surgery.][4]\n\n[Life-threatening infection almost costed woman her legs.][5]\n\n\nI should mention that probably the biggest risk lies with the anesthesia. Several other news relate people dying because of the anesthesia in other common surgeries, some of them purely aesthetic (like liposuction).

I'd prefer to keep my varicose veins, at least until I know the numbers about the risk they represent.\n\nAlso, when you look for information in doctor's and medical clinics websites, they don't explicitly mention all the risks involved. [Here][8] and [here][9] are two Brazilian examples. In English, we have other examples. The respected [Johns Hopkins][10] tells nothing about the biggest risks.

You should always consult with a healthcare professional in order to avoid adverse outcomes.*\n\nThe concept of manipulating urine pH in order to accelerate the excretion of certain drugs is [well-known][1]. It is related to acid-base properties of drugs, as most drugs are weak acids or bases (I will not go into detail about this here, as it is a very basic concept in pharmacology, and can be looked up in most textbooks. You can also read a bit about it [here][2]).\n\nThe mechanism of increasing excretion rate of certain drugs is related to a phenomenon called \"[ion trapping][3]\". Basically it means that since acids will be ionized (become charged) in basic pH and bases will be ionized in acidic pH, and ionized species have difficulties passing through membranes, changing urine pH can eventually cause a certain drug to concentrate in the urine. <br>(drugs pass from blood to urine according to their ability to pass membranes. In general, if a drug is uncharged it can go back and forth, but if it becomes charged, it would be more difficult for it to move across membranes, so it is essentially \"stuck\" where it became charged, which is preferably the urine).\n\n[![Ion trapping][4]][4]\n\nIn other words, the normal range of urine pH is 4.6-8 (see [here][5]), which means that it fluctuates between acidic and basic values (pH value of 7 is neutral). When the urine is **acidic**, **basic** molecules that pass from the blood to the urine become ionized (charged), and then cannot go back into the blood (i.e. they are **trapped in the urine** and are excreted from the body more quickly).<br> When the urine is **basic**, **acidic** molecules that pass from the blood to the urine become ionized and are excreted from the body more quickly.\n\nTo address your specific question: The commonly accepted method for making the urine more basic (i.e. alkalinization) is to administer sodium bicarbonate [**intravenously**][6]. I found a [study][7] about administering sodium bicarbonate orally, but it is not the common practice. Also note that methamphetamine is a weak base (pKa = 9.87, according to [DrugBank][8]), so it will be excreted more quickly by **acidification** of the urine, and not **alkalinization** (acidification is usually done with vitamin C).\n\n[![Methamphetamine excretion affected by urine pH manipulation][9]][9]\n\nFinally, I would like to point out that one tablespoon of baking soda in 8 oz of water is not very precise and has a relatively high potential for error, which may lead to too high urine pH. I repeat my warning: *stay away from this kind of practice, as unsupervised manipulation of blood/urine pH may have adverse and even fatal reactions*.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gtfch.org/cms/images/stories/media/tk/tk71_3/Scholer.pdf\n  [2]: http://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/clinical-pharmacology/pharmacokinetics/drug-absorption\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_trapping\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tUCxN.png\n  [5]: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003583.htm\n  [6]: http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/Datasheet/s/SodiumBicarbonateinjAFT.pdf\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24055481\n  [8]: https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01577\n  [9]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZxeV.png", "11120": "The one thing I would add to your natural remedy is cranberry juice and/or dried cranberries.

The BV of an egg, for example is [somewhere around 93][4] (see column 5). For cooked chicken, [a bit over 70][5]. \n\nIt's hard to find sources for protein powder/shakes that don't seem biased (being from the manufactors of the protein, or bodybuilding sites), but here's a study from the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine: [Protein - Which is best?][6]. It uses an adjusted scale, where a whole egg has a biological value of 100. In that scale, since whey protein has a higher BV than whole egg, it comes out as 104. Soy protein and casein have BVs in the mid-70s, a bit lower than beef.\n\nAs for whether they have the same effect, well, what's different betrween different sources of protein is *composition*. Proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, of which there are 20 in food. Many of those can be converted from one to the other or made from other things we eat, but [9 amino acids are called 'essential'][7] and have to be eaten. Different foods, including protein powders differ in what amino acids they have. Usually, protein powders will contain these. How much they contain will depend on the product. \n\nKeep in mind that no source of is 'perfect' in that regard, either. A bean does not have the same amino acid composition in its proteins as a human body does. Neither does whey protein. Deficiency in essential amino acids isn't pleasant, [but it is rare in people who aren't generally malnutritient and  consume enough protein overall, from more than one source][8].\n\n***Vitamins***\n\nBasically, a lot of the same applies for vitamins. They aren't perfectly bioavailable when digested from food *or* from a multivitamin, sometimes one is better, sometimes the other. Answering this for all vitamins is way too broad, and it probably also depends on the product. The paper [Multivitamin and multimineral dietary supplements: definitions, characterization, bioavailability, and drug interactions][9] goes into a few of the problems and general concepts. \n\nFor example, it looks like the bioavailibility of folic acid taken up from dietery supplements [is higher than that from food][10], and especially outperforms [spinach and yeast][11] (warning: low number of subjects in study...). For vitamin C, [Synthetic or Food-Derived Vitamin C\u2014Are They Equally Bioavailable?][12] summarizes:\n\n> In contrast, all steady state comparative bioavailability studies in humans have shown no differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, regardless of the subject population, study design or intervention used. Some pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown transient and small comparative differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, although these differences are likely to have minimal physiological impact\n\nAnd goes on to say:\n\n> Although synthetic and food-derived vitamin C appear to be equally bioavailable in humans, ingesting vitamin C as part of a whole food is considered preferable because of the concomitant consumption of numerous other macro- and micronutrients and phytochemicals, which will confer additional health benefits. \n\nSo whole foods are preferable, but the vitamin C that you get from the supplements itself isn't any better or worse than the vitamin C an apple contains, and certainly isn't unhealthy. \n\n\n\nFor some people, getting all vitamins they need from their diet is either impossible or very hard (vitamin D and iron deficiencies are rather common) and that's where supplements like the protein bars you use come in.  As pointed out by Atl LED in the comments, though, for vitamin supplements to work it's important to take care of how the multivitamins need to be taken. If they need to be taken with food for maximum absorption, that's important or else you won't get the full benefits. \n\nIf protein bars are judged as 'unhealthy' it should be because of things like their sugar content, but it's certainly not true that the proteins or vitamins in them are  unhealthy or that we can't use them at all.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioequivalence\n  [3]: http://www.food-info.net/uk/protein/bv.htm\n  [4]: http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/AC854T/AC854T74.htm#chII.I.7\n  [5]: http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/AC854T/AC854T74.htm#chII.I.6\n  [6]: http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf\n  [7]: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002222.htm\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/\n  [9]: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/269S.full\n  [10]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17284745\n  [11]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15447898\n  [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847730/", "5137": "The Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time is a test measuring clotting factors, not a level of clotting factors in your blood.

While decaffeinated coffee still has some residual caffeine, it would not be enough to have the same effect as fully caffeinated drinks.\n\nAs far as the excretion of other substances, [this study][4] examined the effect of caffeine on excretion of certain elements (calcium, sodium, magnesium and potassium), with the conclusion that all but potassium had higher urinary output levels after caffeine consumption.

Endoscopy and colonoscopy may both miss Crohn's, however, because - unlike UC - Crohn's can skip around in the small intestines; though it is most common in the ilium (the terminal portion of the small bowel) and the proximal colon, it can cause ulceration anywhere from the mouth to the rectum. It can come and go with remissions lasting for years, and, interestingly, Crohn's is often accompanied by abdominal pain and feelings of low energy and fatigue, as well as possible weight loss and malnutrition. Celiac Disease can present in a mild form with only unexplained iron deficiency anemia (from malabsorption) to chronic diarrhea with fatigue and weight loss.\n\nAlso interestingly, Crohn's responds to anti-inflammatory drugs, though the wrench in this scenario is that NSAIDs usually make it worse, not better.\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease is a difficult problem, but there are effective treatments for Crohn's. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a common cause of episodiic diarrhea (sometimes alternating with constipation). IBS can come and go as well.\n\nThere are new tests for Crohn's (e.g. fecal biomarkers) and IBS.\n\nIf by no food allergies you mean you've had skin testing, then true food allergies have likely not been ruled out, as skin testing is not reliable.  Celiac Disease is diagnosed best by positive serology, positive small bowel biopsy *and* a favorable clinical response to a diet eliminating wheat gluten/gliadin (and perhaps barley and rye as well.) \n\nWhat can someone with persistent symptoms without a diagnosis do?\n\nFirst, they can try an elimination diet. A person can do that without seeing a doctor. Also keep a food diary. That's always a good idea with any gastrointestinal problems.\n\nThey might talk to their gastroenterologist about different trials.

There are still a lot of studies being conducted and many of the answers aren't in. \n\nA bit of background. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV - the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis) is a member of the herpesvirus family, very \"successful\" viruses in that most of the world's population are infected (90% of the world's population has been infected with EBV), and the viruses are known to remain in the host's body throughout their lifetimes (that is, the host doesn't usually die from the disease, instead living to pass it on to others). With Herpes Simplex, reactivation is in the form of cold sores. With varicella-zoster virus - the cause of chickenpox - reactivation takes the form of \"shingles\". So, to expect EBV of periodic reactivation isn't very far fetched.\n\nIn the US, ~50% of the population seroconverts (becomes infected as manifested by antibodies to the virus) before 5 years of age. This population has not been extensively studied for asymptomatic viral shedding. In the rest of the population, most cases of EBV infection are still subclinical, but some adolescents and young adults - about 25% of those newly infected - get the illness known as infectious mononucleosis (IM). This has been the group most studied group in terms of who is shedding virus and who isn't.\n\nOnce infected, humans carry the virus for life in a small number of white blood cells called \"memory B lymphocytes\". Immediately following infection, the cells shedding the most virus are pharyngeal epithelial cells (though this has been challenged), so virus is present in the saliva, but has also been found in other bodily fluids.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nOne study in France followed 30 patients for 6 months: 20 after diagnosis of IM, and 10 healthy EBV carriers (determined by the presence of IgG antibodies against EBV and the absence of IgM) as controls. Blood and  saliva samples were collected at day 0 [D0]), D3, D7, D15, D30, D60, D90, and D180 on all subjects.\n\nInfectivity of saliva was determined by lymphocyte transformation in cell cultures of fresh cord-blood lymphocytes.\n\nAll newly infected patients had sustained viral shedding in the saliva, and all still had infectious saliva at day 180, 16 patients maintaining a *high* EBV load during the 6 months of follow-up, and 4 showing a *low* level of virus, though viral load was significantly lower at D180 than at D90 in all patients. Of the *controls* (healthy people who had positive antibodies), 8 subjects had 2\u20134 episodes of detectable EBV in their saliva, with the remaining 2 having no EBV in their saliva during the follow-up period. \n\nIn the patient blood samples, EBV-infected B cells decreased significantly from day 0 to day 180, with 18 showing a viral rebound between D30 and D90. Among these 18, 4 patients had tonsillitis and lymphadenopathy (!) which indicates a recurrence. Only one of the control subjects showed no detectable  EBV in their Memory B Cells during the entire follow-up period. This shows that patients with IM remain highly infectious during convalescence.\n\nA Japanese study analyzed the prevalence of EBV in saliva and throat washings from healthy people. EBV DNA was detected in 43 of 48 throat washings from healthy adults aged 21 to 57 years of age, and in 35 of 93 salivas from healthy children 0 to 6 years old. Umbilical cord lymphocytes were transformed by some throat washings from EBV seropositive donors, indicating infectivity of the virus. Furthermore, EBV DNA was detected in throat washings from 2 healthy adults whose *EBV antibody was not detected*. \n\nIn a study of 22 healthy EBV-seropositive blood donors over a period of 15 months, serology suggested reactivation (significant changes in viral load plus a serological response) in eight donors. Another five individuals also exhibited significant changes in viral load but no serologic response. Of the 13 volunteers with significant increases in viral load, 6 had a period of viremia accompanying the rise in viral load, that is, *they had a viral infection clinically.*  \n\nWhat triggers reactivation in healthy subjects is not known precisely. The presumption is that it occurs when latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections, because B-cell receptor stimulation triggers reactivation in B-cell lines. \n\nSo, whatever you have read, there is probably proof for it, as well as much else that wasn't read! It appears that healthy adults and children shed virus intermittently for an unknown number of years.\n\n\n<sub>Image from *On the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis*, Hadinoto et al, Blood. 2008 Feb 1; 111(3): 1420\u20131427.</sub>\n\n<sub>[Infectious Mononucleosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/222040-overview#showall)</sub>   \n<sub>[Progress and Problems in Understanding and Managing Primary Epstein-Barr Virus Infections](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021204/)</sub>       \n<sub>[Long-Term Shedding of Infectious Epstein-Barr Virus after Infectious\nMononucleosis](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/191/6/985.full.pdf+html)</sub>  \n<sub>[Detection of Epstein-Barr virus in salivas and throat washings in healthy adults and children](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S128645790000277X)</sub>  \n<sub>[Molecular Parameters for Precise Diagnosis of Asymptomatic Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation in Healthy Carriers](http://jcm.asm.org/content/41/12/5419.short)</sub>  \n<sub>[On the dynamics of acute EBV infection and the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2214734/)</sub>\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/v8u7F.jpg", "1467": "The **Maisonneuve fracture is a special form of the Weber C fracture**.

How much fat reserves your body decides to keep will depend on your physical fitness and physical activity levels, the intake of minerals that are essential for maintaining physical fitness, how much sleep you get etc. etc. In general, when you live an unhealthy lifestyle, your body's regulation of its metabolic rate will tend to lead to larger fat reserves.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, this is quite easy to understand. Whatever the precise biochemical mechanisms are that are involved in regulating metabolism (not everything is known), it remains the case that all these mechanisms have evolved in order to maximize survival probability of animals in Nature who  obviously don't do calorie counting.\n\nOne of the problems evolution had to solve was how to make sure you don't starve to death due to a small shortage in the energy balance that you cannot make up for. Suppose you eat one sandwich a day worth 100 Kcal a day less and walk a bit more so that you expend 100 Kcal more per day. While this could lead to some weight loss, it cannot be the case that you'll continue to lose weight without limit. However, naive the calorie counting hypothesis suggests that a 200 Kcal deficit per day would lead to a long term weight loss trend of 1 kg of fat per 40 days. So, in a little over 2 years you would lose 20 kg of weight, which is clearly nonsense.\n\nAnimals living in the wild may find themselves having to deal with a bit less food that is also a bit harder to find. If they were to lose weight because the metabolic rate is cannot be actively regulated, it would only increase due to physical exertion, the animal would be doomed. This doesn't make sense for warm blooded animals that we know have mechanisms to regulate the metabolic rate, and who have metabolic rates that are ten times higher than what they need to just barely survive.\n\nInstead, it makes far more sense to make the metabolic rate dependent on the degree to which the fat cells are filled. So, if there is a shortage on the energy balance, the animal will initially lose weight, but then the metabolic rate will be down regulated, correcting the energy balance, a slight surplus  will be created, allowing the fat cells to be filled. \n\nWhile the biochemical mechanisms the body uses for this are not well understood, but recently [it has been found][1] that fat cells produce leptin, the more filled a fat cell is the more leptin is produced and besides regulating the appetite, leptin will let the hypothalamus produce more TRH, and TRH will let the pituitary gland produce more TSH and TSH will let the thyroid gland produce more thyroid hormone.\n\nThen the body will likely also make the set point for the fat reserves dependent on factors such as the amount of food intake, stress levels, sleep etc. The whole point of the fat reserves is to maximize survival probability, so the probability of a food emergency, the time it can survive without food etc. will all influence the set point for its fat reserves. It then makes sense that the outcome of evolution would be that the set point would be set higher when the animal has less to eat, has more stress doesn't get the optimal; amount of sleep. In that case, a food emergency is more likely and when it happens it is less likely to survive on some given amount of fat reserves. So, the smart thing to do is to save more energy under these circumstances.\n\nIn contrast, when you sleep better, eat more and exercise more, the body will think that the prospects of a food emergency are smaller, and if that were to happen you would be in stronger position to take measures to reverse the situation. So, you'll not keep as much fat reserves, because doing so does come at the cost of having to carry all that fat ballast with you all the time.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10967095", "1340": "We can't diagnose your friend on the internet; only her doctors can do that.

But to my knowledge (and I have seen and treated many metallic foreign bodies), iron toxicity from such an exposure would be unlikely.\n\nAside from ingestion, the two most common reasons for iron overload are \n\n1) repeated transfusions required for various anemias (where red blood cells are destroyed by the body and need to be replaced), or when bone marrow has stopped functioning properly and RBC's must be supplied; this is called **secondary hemochromatosis**,\n\n2) iron-overload disorders owing to genetic misregulation of iron absorption, referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis (or **primary hemochromatosis**). \n\nPrimary hemochromatosis can be treated by removing blood periodically, forcing the body to use up the excess iron, or by chelation therapy. So, untreated, yes, iron overload from this source is permanent. Acute iron toxicity can be treated with chelating agents is severe enough.\n\nWhile hemochromatosis is not rare, fainting is *very common* (so common it is difficult to estimate it's occurrence due to underreporting); rough estimates are that *at least* 35% of the population will have at least one episode in their lifetime. There is a bimodal distribution, with the first peak around the late teens (one-third of medical students report at least one syncopal episode) and the second starting around the seventies.\n\nAgain, numbers are hard to obtain for fainting (syncope), but the most common cause is vasovagal (fear, pain, prolonged standing, etc.), followed by cardiac causes.\n\nAlthough fainting is common, the only real way to determine its probable cause is to see a medical professional, who can gather the information necessary to make a diagnosis.\n\n\n<sub>[Hemochromatosis (Iron Storage Disease)](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemochromatosis/training/epidemiology/prevalence.html)</sub>  \n<sub>[Molecular basis of HFE-hemochromatosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949417/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Epidemiology of syncope/collapse in younger and older Western patient populations](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472771)</sub>  \n<sub>[Incidence and prognosis of syncope](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12239256)</sub>", "1199": "Like almost all products, there are some side effects that come with using chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (CGM). Luckily, they are usually very minor and the ones that are more serious are extremely rare.

There are also more serious side effects that can come from using CGM, but these are mostly allergic reactions to its ingredients and are very rare. The FDA<sup>[2]</sup> has also said that serious allergic allergic reactions can occur from using products with chlorhexidine gluconate.\n\n> Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine.\n\nThere are studies that agree with the information that WebMD has said. Many of them are older, but the results of them are still reliable. A 1988 study<sup>[3]</sup> testing out the difference between 0.1% and 0.2% CGM. It found that with both there were possible minor side effects like discoloration and loss of taste. The only noticeable difference between the two is that the test subjects preferred the taste of the 0.1% CGM.\n\nThere are also two studies from the 1980's<sup>[4],</sup> <sup>[5]</sup> that suggest that CGM can also cause gingival bleeding. The studies did notice a slight increase in the frequency of gingival bleeding when using CGM as opposed to mechanical oral care.\n\nThough there are side effects that can occur from using CGM, they are most likely not going to be very severe. Also, it is most likely that the benefits of using CGM will outweigh the risks. A 2006 study on both topical chlorhexidine gluconate and CGM<sup>[6]</sup> found that the topical and mouthrinse both helped treat plaque and prevent gingivitis when used properly.\n\nOdds are, your dentist told you to use CGM because of the swelling of your gums, a sign of gingivitis.

It is dependent of age, sex, population and fat-free mass, i.e. the mass of muscles in your body, which consume a lot of energy just for maintenance. Studies show that it can vary individually [between 1000 and 2500 kcal/day](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280423) within just one population. Many factors and energy consumers contribute to the basal metabolic rate, but approximately 70% of it [is used for maintenance of the body's main organs](http://www.fao.org/3/contents/3079f916-ceb8-591d-90da-02738d5b0739/M2845E00.HTM), and the rest is used for physical activity (in an average human) and for thermogenesis and digesting your food.\n\nIt is not known why exactly the BMR decreases with age. While it can be partly attributed to lifestyle changes after early adulthood with decrease in exercise and physical activity, studies show that it is [not the only contributing factor](http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/259/2/E233.short).

Many of the supplements on the market that claim to boost testosterone do increase the amount of these three hormones, but in most cases, do not lead to concurrent elevations in testosterone. (There is a [chart showing a study review with outcomes here][1]).\n\nAs far as the side effects, it's best summarized by the same review paper that produced the above chart:\n>**Side Effects**\n>\n>Significant reductions in serum HDL cholesterol of 12% and 20% have been observed after A'dione and DHEA supplementation, respectively. Similar changes have been observed after AAS injection and have been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. Broeder et al administered either A'dione or A'diol (200 mg/d) and observed that both adversely affected HDL-cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-to-HDL cholesterol ratios, and coronary heart disease risk. Thus, it is possible that long-term supplementation could have serious side effects similar to those associated with AAS use, such as **suppressed testosterone production, liver dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, testicular atrophy, male-pattern baldness, acne, and aggressive behavior. If the supplements are taken before puberty, premature closing of the epiphysis and stunted growth could occur. In women, precursor-induced increases in testosterone concentrations could cause lowered voice pitch, hirsutism (changes in hair growth patterns, including facial hair), increased abdominal fat accumulation, and general virilization. Furthermore, increases in estrogen concentrations experienced by men could have feminizing effects, including gynecomastia.**\n\nIn addition to the above, there is no regulation on the supplement industry, so they may contain wildly varying levels of ingredients (Even in the same brand/line), and there have been reports of heavy metal contamination as well as contamination with actual steroid substances.\n\nCurrently, you can really sum up the supplement industry in this way: If it works, it's illegal and should be only used under a doctor's care. If it is safe to use, it probably doesn't work like they claim. Also, while many people do not realize it, if you participate in 5k fun runs, amateur cycling, or any amateur competition where the governing body adheres to USADA (or the local national equivalent) strictures, you can be subject to testing, no matter your competitive level.

During a breath hold, carbon dioxide levels rise and oxygen levels fall. Carbon dioxide diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and causes a decrease in CSF pH sensed at central chemoreceptors in the brainstem. The peripheral serum pH may also be depressed, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. In normally ventilating people, these \"hypercarbic indicators\" are the primary mediators of the drive to breath.\n\nIn patients with chronic hypoventilation, PaCO<sub>2</sub> is chronically elevated. Common hypo-ventilatory diseases include:\n\n- COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n- obesity-hypoventilation syndrome\n- neuro-muscular weakness syndromes (generally only in later phases when the diaphragm is affected: Becker/Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.)\n\nThe old theory goes that because these folks have chronically elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub>*, the hypercarbic respiratory feedback loop described above \u201cacclimates\u201d and is no longer the primary driver of breathing. Instead, they rely on the [hypoxic respiratory drive][hrd], which is secondary in normal people. These individuals may have a usual SpO<sub>2</sub> ~88-90%. When a non-rebreather mask is applied and suddenly drives their SpO<sub>2</sub> up to 100%, their respiratory drive decreases because their blunted hypercarbic response mechanisms do not respond normally to the progressive rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>. \n\nThere are data in support of this theory. [One study in COPD patients][ma] administered 100% oxygen to patients with COPD and observed a 18% decrease in ventilation after 15 minutes that returned to baseline when oxygen was removed (Aubier). However, these authors also showed that two other factors were at play explaining the observed rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>:\n\n1.  About 30% of the  increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> associated with high-flow oxygen administration was attributable to the [Haldane effect], which is basically an offloading of CO2 by hemoglobin (due to a rightward shift of the carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curve), increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in blood but not reflecting a true change in ventilation. \n\n2. An additional 48% of the increase in hypercapnia was due to dead space ventilation. The simplified idea is that the vessels in the lung compensate for hypoxia by vaso-constricting areas with low oxygen tension, so-called ventilation-perfusing matching. When high-flow oxygen is administered, the vaso-constriction is released so perfusion of poorly ventilated areas increases. Now a higher percentage of the blood is not being cleared of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is called ventilation-perfusion  &#8203;**mis**&#8203;matching. \n\n[Something similar has been demonstrated in patients with obesity-hypoventilation][mj] (Wijesinghe). In light of this, [a recent study][ma] investigated the best strategy for oxygen administration in patients with chronic hypoventilation (Kim). They found that a strategy titrating oxygen administration to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> 88% to 92% minimized the risk of worsening hypoventilation while achieving adequate relief of shortness of breath and adequate oxygenation.\n\n[A helpful review of these topics][review] provides a bit more detail for those interested (Abdo).\n\n\n----\n<sub>\nAbdo WF and Heunks LM.

Oxalate (C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>) is a dianion that combines with divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. The magnesium salt is much more soluble than the calcium salt. Because these cations compete for binding to oxalate, both lower magnesium levels and higher calcium levels will tend to cause precipitation (movement out of solution into crystalline form) of calcium oxalate. When this happens in the urine in large enough quantities, it can form \u201cstones.\u201d\n\nDoes diet matter?\n----------  \nAs introduced by the OP, doctors have historically advised patients who have demonstrated a propensity toward calcium oxalate stone formation (or, more generically: kidney stones) to decrease dietary intake of calcium and oxalate.\n\n**Dietary calcium**  \n\nIn 1993, [a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine][gc] dispelled the notion that a low calcium diet should be advised for these patients. They found the opposite association: higher calcium intake correlates with *reduced* stone formation (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.43 - 0.73). This somewhat counter-intuitive effect may be explained by the binding of calcium with oxalate in the gut, which tends to decrease oxalate absorption. The recommendation to decrease calcium intake, then, appears not to be valid. [Further studies][lb] have refined this recommendation, and it is now generally said that a **normal** calcium intake is probably best.\n\n**Dietary oxalate**  \n\nOxalate is found in [an odd assortment of foods][mc]: beets, spinach, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, and all dry beans (fresh, canned, or cooked), excluding lima and green beans. This has largely been a \u201cseems like it should work\u201d approach rather than data-driven. In fact, [large epidemiological studies][et] have not shown an association between oxalate intake and stone formation.\n\n\n**Other dietary associations**  \n\nThe [NEJM study mentioned above][gc] also looked at other correlations between stone formation and dietary components. Animal protein was directly correlated with increased risk of stones, whereas potassium and fluid intake were correlated with decreased risk.\n\n**A different approach**  \n\nThe [most recent interesting development][nn] in this area that I\u2019m aware of was published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease in 2014 and compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-style diet with a low-oxalate diet for prevention of stones. Their reasoning is nicely summarized in the abstract:\n\n>  [M]ost people do not eat isolated nutrients, but meals consisting of a variety of foods with complex combinations of nutrients. A more rational approach to nephrolithiasis prevention would be to base dietary advice on the cumulative effects of foods and different dietary patterns rather than single nutrients.\n\nThe DASH diet was, as its name suggests, developed as a tool to mitigate hypertension, but it has been used as a sort of paradigm \u201chealthy diet\u201d in trials of a variety of interventions. It is, as described in the paper above, high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein. The high fruit and nut content may be expected to increase urinary oxalate, but these foods also tend to be high in magnesium and citrate, both of which are inhibitors of calcium stone formation.\n\nThe authors collected 24-hour urine samples in participants with a known history of stones and randomized them to a DASH diet vs a low-oxalate diet. They found that urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate (a measure of tendency to form calcium oxalate stones) was decreased in the DASH group compared to the low-oxalate group. This occurred despite a trend toward *increased* oxalate excretion in that group. The authors posit that this may have been due to the increased urinary pH and concentrations of citrate, magnesium, and potassium, all of which tend to decrease stone formation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n   \nThere are not solid data supporting a low oxalate diet for stone prevention. Other dietary factors that are probably helpful include: normal calcium intake; high intake of fluid, magnesium, and potassium; low animal protein.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n**References**\n\n<sub>\nBorghi L., Schianchi T., Meschi T., et al: [*Comparison of two diets for the prevention of recurrent stones in idiopathic hypercalciuria.*][lb] N Engl J Med 2002(346):77-84.\n</sub>\n\n<sub>\nCoe FL, Evan A, Worcester E.

Anything that might increase this burden on the lymph nodes remaining post mastectomy (e.g. venipuncture, IVs, finger sticks, etc.) is discouraged.\n\n-----------\nAs most breast cancers (75%) occur in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, lymphatic drainage - and metastatic cancer cells - goes to the axillary nodes. Some, all, or none of the nodes are removed with the breast tissue, depending on the cancer and the surgeon. All lymph passes through lymph nodes, so when some are removed, the remaining nodes filter more fluid than normally.\n\nThe arm on the mastectomy side is **permanently** off limits to any procedures (technically even blood pressure measurements) if any lymph nodes were removed during the mastectomy (they do not grow back), or if there as been radiation (which damages lymph nodes) to that side. That's because there are a reduced number of lymph nodes in the underarm area to handle the work of the lymphatic system for that arm, and doing anything which might stress the remaining nodes can cause permanent swelling of the arm (lymphedema.)\n\n>[The goal is to reduce your risk of developing lymphedema.](https://www.oncolink.org/frequently-asked-questions/cancers/blood-pressures-and-ivs-after-mastectomy) Having a mastectomy alone does not put you at risk for lymphedema. The risk comes when you have lymph nodes removed or damaged. If you had any of the following, you should take precautions to reduce your risk of lymphedema:\n>\n>-Removal of all lymph nodes in the underarm area, which is called an axillary node dissection  \n>-Removal of a limited number of \u201ckey\u201d lymph nodes from the underarm area, which is called sentinel lymph node biopsy    \n>-Having radiation to the chest wall and armpit after surgery\n\nDuring routine admission to the hospital for something unrelated, if the patient has had a mastectomy or radiation, a brightly colored band is placed on the affected wrist to alert all staff to use the other side if there is a chance you may not be able to voice an opinion (e.g. in the OR or under sedation from pain meds). \n\nLymphedema can occur any time after mastectomy, often in the first 5 years, but has occurred even up to 20 years later. Because lymphedema is such a problematic condition, anything to reduce the possibility of it developing is recommended, even if the probability is low.\n\n>[Patients with lymphedema have chronic, progressive swelling, pain, recurrent infections, and significantly decreased quality of life.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652571/) The swelling can progress to gigantic proportions causing gross disfigurement with severe detrimental effects. In addition, lymphedema is a significant source of biomedical expenditures with one recent study demonstrating a more than $10,000 increase in the annual treatment costs of cancer survivors with lymphedema as compared with those without lymphedema6.\n>\n>Treatment for lymphedema remains suboptimal and is, in most cases palliative with a goal of preventing disease progression rather than a cure. Medical and surgical treatments have been reported but in general these therapies have been disappointing...\n\nThere is no way to know who will develop lymphedema and who will not. The greater the number of axillary lymph nodes removed, the greater the chance of lympedema, but even people with as few as 2 nodes removed have developed it. Therefore, with or without strong supporting evidence, an abundance of caution is advised, as lymphedema is such a terrible post-operative complication.", "20485": "Why do we need ketone bodies?\n-\n\nThe main role of **ketone bodies** is to serve as a fuel (mainly for the brain) when there are not enough dietary carbohydrates available (during a low-carbohydrate diet or fasting) to produce glucose, which is otherwise the main fuel in the human body. Additionally, ketones can be used as a fuel in untreated diabetes mellitus type 1, in which glucose is available but can't enter the cells, but ketones can. \n\nDuring **fasting,** your liver and kidneys (but not other organs) can produce *some* glucose by [gluconeogenesis][1] from glucogenic amino acids (from your body protein), glycerol (from your body fat), lactate (from glycolysis in muscles) and from pyruvate. \nThe amount of glucose produced by gluconeogenesis is sufficient to meet the demands of organs that can use glucose as the only fuel (the testes, renal medulla and erythrocytes), but not the brain (which needs ~120 g glucose/day). The brain can use ketones, **but not fatty acids,**\n\n> ...because they are bound to albumin in plasma and so do not traverse\n> the blood-brain barrier ([Biochemistry, J.M.

For example, *all* reference ranges for vitamin B12 in the blood are unreliable, because the blood levels of B12 only poorly reflect the actual B12 status in the body. It is often only **a combination of tests** that can reliably reflect a certain situation.   \n\nIn general, the reference ranges of the blood tests have been determined on the basis of decades of studies from around the world that have shown which ranges have been associated with minimal incidence of symptoms and diseases. Different health authorities may judge the background evidence differently, so this is why reference ranges can be different.\n\nThere is a suggestion that every **country** should determine their own reference ranges:\n\n> International guidelines recommend that every country must establish\n> reference intervals for healthy individuals belonging to a group of\n> homogeneous population. ([Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry, 2009][1])\n\n...and some countries have and others haven't determined them. Sometimes, reference ranges can also differ among hospitals and labs, and they can change with time.\n\n----------\n\nHere are few examples how the blood tests need to be judged regardless of reference ranges:    \n\n**1) NORMAL BLOOD VALUES MAY NOT REFLECT DEFICIENCY - Calcium**\n\nBlood calcium levels can remain normal for years even in a person with severe calcium deficiency, because calcium leached from the bones maintains normal blood levels.\n\n[What serum calcium can tell us and what it can't (Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation, 2005)][3]:\n\n> When dietary calcium intake is inadequate (<600\u2009mg/day in young\n> adults) and/or intestinal calcium absorption abnormal, the serum\n> calcium level can be kept stable only at the cost of a gradual\n> depletion of bone calcium stores.\n\nSo, the [bone mineral density][4] can more accurately show the calcium status.\n\n**2) PERSONAL DIFFERENCES - Vitamin B12**\n\nSymptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can occur at very different B12 levels in different individuals:\n\n> Subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency (usually defined as a total serum\n> B12 of <200 pmol/L) presents asymptomatically or with rather subtle\n> generic symptoms that oftentimes are mistakenly ascribed to unrelated\n> disorders. Numerous studies have now established that **serum vitamin\n> B12 has limited diagnostic value as a stand-alone marker.** Low serum\n> levels of vitamin B12 not always represent deficiency, and likewise,\n> severe functional deficiency of the micronutrient has been documented\n> in the presence of normal and even high levels of serum vitamin B12. ([Frontiers in Biomolecular Sciences, 2016][5])\n\nMethylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may more accurately reflect the B12 status, because they indicate a metabolic change that is highly specific to B12 deficiency ([Office of Dietary Supplements][10]).\n\n**3) ETHNIC FACTORS - blood cells**\n\nNormal reference ranges can differ among ethnic groups:\n\n> This current study included 3,077 participants aged 18\u201365 years\n> who reported their health status as \u201cExcellent,\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d or\n> \u201cGood,\u201d with known race/ethnicity as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian.\n> Quantile regression analyses adjusted for sex were conducted to\n> evaluate racial/ethnic differences in the normal ranges of 38\n> laboratory tests. **Significant racial/ethnic differences were found\n> in almost all laboratory tests.** Compared to whites, the normal range\n> for Asians significantly shifted to higher values in globulin and\n> total protein and to lower values in creatinine, hematocrit,\n> hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration,\n> and mean platelet volume.

So, the environmental factors can influence *actual* blood levels but they do not need to influence what *reference ranges* should be.

There are many examples and they share a common structure.\n\n***\nDopamine\n[![Dopamine][2]][2]\n***\nAdrenaline (epinephrine)\n[![Adrenaline (epinephrine)][3]][3]\n***\n\nNotice the common structure of catechol (the carbon ring with two hydroxyl (OH) groups) and an amine (NH<sub>2</sub>) group.\n\nThis group of hormones and neurotransmitters act as part of the [sympathetic nervous system][4], which is one of two mutually-antagonising arms of the autonomic nervous system. Both are active all the time to maintain [homeostasis][5], but the sympathetic nervous system also stimulates *fight or flight* activity (increase heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output, for example), while the opposing [parasympathetic nervous system][6] promotes more routine tasks (*rest and digest, feed and breed*).\n\n***\n\n**Methamphetamine**\n\nMethamphetamine is a stimulant drug. This information is taken from a paper on the [pharmacologic mechanisms of crystal meth][7]:\n\n> Methamphetamine causes the release of the neurotransmitters dopamine,\n> norepinephrine and serotonin and activates the cardiovascular and\n> central nervous systems.\n\nMethamphetamine is similar to other amphetamines and cocaine, in that it has stimulant properties, but it also has a longer elimination half-life. It takes longer for it to be broken down and removed by the body.\n\n***\n\n**Dental anaesthetic** \n\nDental anaesthetic usually has two components; an anaesthetic (often lidocaine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) which causes localised vasoconstriction to reduce bleeding.\n\nLidocaine can have adverse effects if a significant amount is absorbed systemically. The effects tend to depress the cardiovascular system, as opposed to the stimulant effect of catecholamines. However, it is the adrenaline which confers the risk in this case, as it is also a catecholamine.\n\n***\n\n**The interaction**\n\nThe problem arises due to excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system due to the increased levels of these catecholamines as a result of methamphetamine use, combined with the absorption of additional adrenaline as part of the dental anaesthetic.\n\nThis can result in haemodynamic instability and heart arrhythmias (like [ventricular tachycardia][8]) as part of a catecholamine surge. \n\nA local anaesthetic without the vasoconstrictor can be offered if there is concern about the risk.\n\n***\n\n**Other conditions**\n\nThere are some diseases in which there is increased endogenous catecholamines (such as [pheochromocytoma][9]). Dental anaesthetic could have a similar risk in these cases. I cannot find specific evidence fo quantify the risk, but this may reflect the fact that these conditions are rare.\n\nEven in common conditions like ischaemic heart disease and hypertension, the vasoconstricting adrenaline may be avoided by dentists.\n\nTo answer your final question regarding the stimulant medication used to treat [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder][10] (ADHD), I found a source of [professional dental education][11].\n\n> Local anesthesia should be used with caution with the patient with\n> ADHD. The dental practitioner should seek to achieve profound\n> anesthesia so that endogenous epinephrine is not released, which could\n> react with medications (especially methylphenidate). In addition, an\n> aspirating syringe must be used to avoid intravascular injections and\n> the possibility of a summation of drug effects from the\n> vasoconstrictor, which could increase BP and heart rate.\n\nSo it seems there is a risk with methylphenidate, but this paper implies that it is not as significant as might be seen with methamphetamine use. This is perhaps not surprising as licensed medication will be precisely dosed and monitored, unlike unregulated illicit drugs.

If you didn't think of something to report, or didn't think (for example) that your nausea was related to your headaches (and so didn't report it), then your headache type may be misdiagnosed. Personally, I received several different \"headache diagnoses\" over the years, depending on how I reported my symptoms and the doctor I was seeing at the time.\n\nIn 2003, a group of researchers published a study (Lipton) where they determined the ID Migraine test was a reliable screening test for determining whether a patient had migraine. This test was further validated by additional studies in 2011 (Cousins), and has since been translated into additional languages and studied further (Karli). \n\n**ID Migraine Test**\n\nThe ID Migraine test is considered positive for migraine if the patient answers yes to 2 or more of the following 3 questions:\n\n- Has a headache limited your activities for a day or more in the last three months?\n- Are you nauseated or sick to your stomach when you have a headache?\n- Does light bother you when you have a headache?\n\n**Migraine Symptoms** \n\nMore generally, the [symptoms of migraine][1] may include:\n\n- Pain on one side or both sides of your head\n- Pain that has a pulsating, throbbing quality\n- Sensitivity to light, sounds and sometimes smells\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Blurred vision\n- Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting\n- Aura \n  - Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light\n  - Vision loss\n  - Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg\n  - Speech or language problems (aphasia)\n\n\nHow to classify severity of migraine\n--\nSeverity of migraine is usually judged based on how the symptoms affect the patient's ability to conduct daily activities. There are several scales available to test this, but the two most popular seem to be the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT).\n\n**MIDAS**\n\nMIDAS was developed in 2001 (Steward) and is based on asking the patient to count the number of days they have been impacted by their headaches (specifically addressing work, household, and social activities). The more days a person is impacted, the more severe their migraine is considered.  MIDAS can be [found online][2] at the American Headache Society.\n\n**HIT**\n\nHIT is a newer test, developed in 2011 (Yang). It asks the patient to consider the impact of migraine on their activities in the past 4 weeks, on a five point scale that progresses from \"Never\" to \"Always\". Having more responses on the positive end of the scale (Sometimes/Very Often/Always) will indicate that a person is more severely affected by migraine. The HIT can be [found online][3] on the National Headaches Foundation.\n\nReferences\n---\nCousins G1, Hijazze S, Van de Laar FA, Fahey T.

I'm not sure about Riverside, but when there was a West Nile Outbreak in Fontana about a decade back, the city would distribute these fish for free; you can also find them at larger aquarium suppliers.  These fish are a genetic variant bred specifically with special traits that allow them to survive and breed under conditions such as standing water and lack of heating, and they feed on mosquitos and their larvae.  We had a 100 gallon outdoor tank that we kept out in the open but to the side of the house where there was the least amount of foot traffic, covered with chicken wire, and added some java ferns/moss to give the fish cover to work with.  Any mosquitos within the immediate vicinity of the property would naturally be attracted to the tank first, and then fish would then happily do their job.  This method may seem counter-intuitive, and there's the added element of risk when you're creating an attractant rather than a deterrent, but it is arguably \"green\" as a pest control method and I can vouch for it's effectiveness...\n\nEDIT: For scientific references, please refer to [this][3] and [this][4] article as cited in the Oxford paper (#2 & #6) and pointed out by @CareyGregory.\n\n\n  [1]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jbGeAZbVttBGuG881EZjmsRjOwGjieIL/view?usp=sharing\n  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeBYu8-QCxA\n  [3]: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-3955(16)35008-8\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559822", "19751": "In [Yoga Journal][1], I've found one description of yoga:\n\n> Classical yoga, however, is *a holistic practice* comprising eight\n> limbs\u2014the physical postures being just one element of *finding peace\n> in oneself.*\n\nThe same author is aware that yoga can mean different things to different people:\n\n> Yoga in Western society often misrepresents the *physical practice,*\n> known as yogasana, as yoga itself.\n\nIt does not appear to me that yoga is meant as a form of treatment.

When gas builds in your intestine, the volume of your abdomen can increase by more than 5 liters, which results in obvious abdominal distension, and the skin does not break.\n\nLet's say that a systolic (upper) arterial blood pressure in a healthy adult is about 120 mm Hg. When an artery breaks and the blood escapes into the chest or abdominal cavity, it instantly loses most of the pressure. If the blood accumulates in a cavity and the pressure within it rises to 120 mm Hg, the blood will no longer escape from the arteries and the pressure in a cavity will no longer increase. But the pressure in the chest or abdominal cavity is very unlikely to increase so much just from few liters of blood, because these cavities are quite expandable, mostly due to the diaphragm muscle that can move up or down a lot. I don't know exact pressures in internal bleeding, but, in one case, removal of 4.5 liters of fluid in a patient with ascites, decreased intraabdominal pressure by only 15 mm Hg (from 45 to 30 mm Hg) ([ajemjournal.com][4]).\n\nAnother comparison: Average see-level atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg. \n\nIn [compartment syndrome][5] (due to bleeding or muscle swelling), the pressure in a limb can increase to as high as [240 mm Hg][6], but I have never read this would result in skin rupture.

Systematic experiments are indicative of the trend that in the cariogenic S. mutans Ingbritt the activity of the synthetizing dextran sucrase is greater by about one power of ten than in S. faecalis.

The ADA has recently advocated using HbA1c for the diagnosis of diabetes and the identification of those at high-risk of developing diabetes. However, at present no other organizations or scientific societies, including the IFCC and the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry (EFCC), have officially endorsed this recommendation. Although a clinical role might exist for screening (i.e., by using a HbA1c cut-off between 6.5% and 7.0%), it seems premature to conclude that HbA1c measurement, at least alone, might be sufficiently accurate to allow wide-spread implementation for the diagnosis of diabetes. At present, its diagnostic role should be limited to those patients with no comorbidities or patho-physiological conditions that might reduce the diagnostic efficiency of this test (Table 2). Whether the old dogma of HbA1c testing for monitoring overall glycemic exposure will translate into a valuable tool for the diagnosis of diabetes, only the future and analysis of its cost effectiveness will determine this role.

", "1967": "This event occurred in the US. In the US, enzootic (dog-to-dog) canine rabies virus has been virtually eliminated through vaccination and stray control programs, making wild animals the primary concern.\n\nIt is quite true, as @EMT_Jedi stated, that rabies is usually caused by an animal's saliva, usually introduced by a bite (e.g. rabid cats, raccoons, etc.) However, this is **not true** of bat-related rabies. There is reason to be vaccinated after any strange contact with a bat. \n\n>The most dangerous and common route of rabies exposure is from the bite of a rabid mammal. An exposure to rabies also might occur when the virus, from saliva or other potentially infectious material (e.g., neural tissue), is introduced into fresh, open cuts in skin or onto *mucous membranes* (nonbite exposure). **...Exposures to bats deserve special assessment because bats can pose a greater risk for infecting humans under certain circumstances that might be considered inconsequential from a human perspective.**\n\nHow dangerous is a bat encounter? From a risk to benefit ratio analysis, they are very, very dangerous. On the one hand, not all bats are infected with rabies, and there are some risks to the vaccine (fewer with the new vaccine, though.) On the other, rabies is considered universally fatal, making the benefit of treatment high. Only a few humans (including [Jeanna Giese](http://hubpages.com/hub/Rabies-in-Humans-Symptoms-and-Treatment)) have ever survived the illness<sup><b>*</sup></b>; until these recent survivals, rabies was considered universally fatal.\n\nDuring 1990-2007, 34 bat-associated human cases of rabies (as determined by identification of the rabies virus variant which killed the victim) were reported in the US: 6 cases reported a bat bite, and 2 reported a probable bite; in 15 cases, physical contact was reported (e.g., the removal of a bat from the home or workplace or the presence of a bat in the room where the person had been sleeping), but no bite was documented; and in 11 cases, no bat encounter was reported, but the rabies virus was bat-specific.\n\nIn other words: Of 34 deaths from bat-related rabies virus, only 8 (or 24%) were associated with a bite/probable bite, 15 cases (44%) involved *touching* a bat, and in 11 cases (32%) had no known exposure to a bat at all, but were caused by a bat.\n\n*Any encounter with a bat, even a dead one, must be evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis.* \n\nIn the case discussed in the OP, the person was previously vaccinated. The CDC recommendation (also verified by the state department of health's epidemiologist), is,\n\n>Previously vaccinated persons... should receive 2 vaccine doses, the first dose immediately and the second dose 3 days later.\n\n(Previously vaccinated persons are those 1. who have previously received complete vaccination regimens (pre-exposure or postexposure) with a cell culture vaccine or 2. persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer.)\n\nRabies cases have occurred among exposed persons who received rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis and did not receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis, indicating that pre-exposure prophylaxis in humans is not universally effective without postexposure prophylaxis. In other words, it doesn't matter if you've been vaccinated or not, if you've been exposed - especially to a bat - you need to be treated. \n\n_________\n\nUnfortunately, in the US, animal rabies is common, and ~23,000 persons/ year receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). (It may well be higher, as no reporting mandate exists.) With the elimination of canine rabies virus variants and enzootic transmission among dogs, human rabies is now rare in the United States, with an average of one or two cases occurring annually since 1960.  \n\nIn the US in 2013, of the three human cases reported, 2 were involved in organ transplants (raccoon rabies virus variant) and one was a Guatemalan (canine rabies virus variant). \n\nIn 2012, one human died from an exposure to a bat. He touched a bat under a bridge. He did not report a bite to a witness. He became ill while traveling, and died in Switzerland. A number of humans exposed to his saliva (including his Swiss caregivers) received PEP.\n\n<sup><b>*</sup></b><sub>Some people in high-rabies areas without the illness have been documented to have developed antibodies to rabies.

Inter-group differences, supposed to be large in broad terms and used to qualify people, turned out to be much smaller than intra-group differences. And the classifications into 'better' or 'worse' turned out to be completely bogus.\n\nBut that does not mean that genetics do not exist or that systematic genetic differences do not exist. For societal classifications these turned out to be meaningless as well.\nFor medical reasons there were some important variables identified that pertain for example to bone marrow transplants. Certain features of the immune system are more often grouped in similar ethnic groups than between dissimilar ethnic groups.\n\nThe [National Marrow Donor Program summarises it as][2] \n> How does a patient's ethnic background affect matching?   \nA patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a matching bone marrow donor or cord blood unit on the Be The Match Registry ranges from 23% to 77% depending on ethnic background. Patients are more likely to match an adult donor of their own ethnic background.\n\nCompare that to blood types. Yes, they exist. As do different colours of skin. But that doesn't mean that A is 'better' than B. They are just differently arranged molecules on blood cells. \n\n> Despite the large number of registered potential donors, the NMDP and unrelated HSC registries worldwide continue to face difficulties in identifying matched donors for some patients, in particular racial/ethnic minorities. ([PUBMED][3])\n>\n> Multiple dimensions of self-identification, including race/ethnicity and geographic ancestry were compared to classifications based on ancestry informative markers (AIMs), and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which are required for transplant matching. Nearly 20% of responses were inconsistent between reporting race/ethnicity versus geographic ancestry. Despite strong concordance between AIMs and HLA, no measure of self-identification shows complete correspondence with genetic ancestry. In certain cases geographic ancestry reporting matches genetic ancestry not reflected in race/ethnicity identification, but in other cases geographic ancestries show little correspondence to genetic measures, with important differences by gender. However, when respondents assign ancestry to grandparents, we observe sub-groups of individuals with well- defined genetic ancestries, including important differences in HLA frequencies, with implications for transplant matching. While we advocate for tailored questioning to improve accuracy of ancestry ascertainment, collection of donor grandparents\u2019 information will improve the chances of finding matches for many patients, particularly for mixed-ancestry individuals.  \n> [Hollenbach et al.: \"Race, Ethnicity and Ancestry in Unrelated Transplant Matching for the National Marrow Donor Program: A Comparison of Multiple Forms of Self-Identification with Genetics\", PLoS One. 2015; 10(8): e0135960.][4]\n\nThey are not incompatible, as racism would describe it. The request with its specifics is just betting on the increased likelihood of finding a donor from a pool of a minority that has an increased likelihood of containing a match but a decreased likelihood of donors from that pool already registered. They might as well find a match from someone grouped into another ethnicity. It is a game of probabilities.\n\nDirectly about the situation in Israel:\n> HLA haplotype frequencies in a volunteer bone marrow donor registry should reflect the frequencies of potential transplant recipients served by that registry, a challenge in a country with diverse subethnicities of immigrants from Eastern and Western cultures, such as Israel. We evaluated the likelihood of finding suitable donors for hypothetical patients drawn from defined subethnicities in the Ezer Mizion Bone Marrow Donor Registry (EM BMDR) from donors both within and outside the registry now and during the coming decade. On average, bioinformatics modeling predicts that, given current donor recruitment trends, 6/6 high-resolution HLA match rates for Israelis, which currently stand at 40% to 55% for most subethnicities, will rise by up to 1% per year over the next decade. Subethnicities with historically lower rates of interethnic admixture are less likely to find matches outside of their designated group but will benefit from expansion of the registry, whereas ethnically directed drives will enhance matching rates for currently underrepresented subethnicities. Donor searches for the same cohort using a large extramural registry was of only slight benefit for most of the 19 EM BMDR subethnicities evaluated, confirming that local donor registries that reflect the ethnic diversity of the community being served are best equipped to serve the needs of their respective communities. Contemporary trends of an increasingly multiethnic admixture in Israel may impact the effect of ethnic profiling in assessing future match rates for EM BMDR.   \n> [Halagan et al.: \"East Meets West\u2014Impact of Ethnicity on Donor Match Rates in the Ezer Mizion Bone Marrow Donor Registry\", Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Volume 23, Issue 8, August 2017, Pages 1381-1386][5], [DOI][6].\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism\n  [2]: https://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/how-does-a-patients-ethnic-background-affect-matching/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578960/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545604/\n  [5]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879117303932\n  [6]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2017.04.005", "18111": "The term \"knee damage\" can encompass many different conditions and injuries so let's just examine at some of the more common ones you might be looking at:\n\nOsteoarthritis\n---\n\n[Osteoarthritis of the knee](https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/conditions/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlYTf4KiG3wIVDrftCh3NCg62EAAYASAAEgKiQPD_BwE) is when the cartilage in the joint has become thin or worn and the body is unable to \"keep up\" with repairs. Walking generally isn't going to cause this unless you are severely overweight or you're walking in unsuitable footwear etc. Quite the reverse - after a period of rest to allow for some recuperation from a flare up walking is recommended as it is a low impact way of building strength in the knee and is good for losing weight etc. *Running* on the other hand is [significantly higher impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11086751) (walking means you experience ground reaction forces of ~ 1.2xBody weight, for running it's ~2.5xBody weight) and can aggravate the damage and you're also much more likely to experience various types of musculoskeletal injuries. Although offsetting that increased risk of injury is the potential for increased cardiovascular fitness from running vs walking.\n\nThis is much more common in older people as the body's ability to repair itself decreases with age. \n\nTendonitis\n---\n\n[Patellla tendonitis](https://physioworks.com.au/injuries-conditions-1/patella-tendonitis-tendinopathy) is an overuse injury where the patella tendon (which connects to the bottom of the knee cap) becomes inflamed or otherwise damaged such as a loss of collagen in the tendon. Similarly to osteoarthritis walking is rarely a cause of this - typically it requires much higher levels of impact than walking alone can produce unless severely overweight or excessive amounts of stair climbing. \n\nThis can also happen in older people where it is the result of repetitive small amounts of damage over an extended period of time - and just like in osteoarthritis as the body's ability to heal falls away the rate of injury can exceed the rate of repair leading to chronic problems.\n\nAvoiding activities that cause pain and keeping up with low impact exercises to improve strength is recommended.\n\nSummary\n---\n\nBasically if you take a sensible approach - walking on reasonably flat surfaces, keep weight low, use appropriate footwear, and apply a modicum of moderation walking generally doesn't do damage to knees unless something has compromised the body's ability to \"repair\" itself to a significant extent. The benefits however are many and can actually help *prevent* damage by improving both the strength of the joint and overall health and fitness.

Food is mainly digested by acid and other enzymes in the stomach to further break down food to a more absorbable form and finally absorbed in the intestines. This is with an exemption to fat which can be only absorbed with the presence of bile for fat emulsification in the duodenum (the part where bile ducts enter the 1st part of small intestine). Nutrients absorbed from food can be classified into Fat, Glucose/Sugar, Proteins, Vitamins, Minerals, and Electrolytes.

To add a little more, rules and regulations for physicians are primarily set by the state medical board and state legislature. States are different in the particulars, but you can make some general statements. [Generally](https://www.fsmb.org/globalassets/advocacy/publications/us-medical-regulatory-trends-actions.pdf), if the treatment is intended to benefit the individual patient, there is informed consent (the unapproved status of the drug is discussed with the patient), and the physician can point to a sound scientific basis for choosing that particular drug, and everything is appropriately documented, there shouldn't be a license issue. There may be a liability risk, though. Personally, I'd be uncomfortable doing it without a compelling reason. \n\nThe specific drug will make a difference.

Smoke from a cigarette is a mixture of evaporated plant material, pyrolised material, burnt paper etc. Quite a lot of substances in differing mixtures.

Lee & Marc W. Fariss: \"A systematic review of possible serious adverse health effects of nicotine replacement therapy\", Archives of Toxicology (2017) 91:1565\u20131594][3]:\n\n> We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and critically evaluate studies of serious adverse health effects (SAHEs) in humans using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. Serious adverse health effects refer to adverse events, leading to substantial dis- ruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Strength of evidence evaluations and conclusions were also determined for the identified SAHEs. We evaluated 34 epidemiological studies and clinical trials, relating NRT use to cancer, reproduction/development, CVD, stroke and/or other SAHEs in patients, and four meta-analyses on effects in healthy populations. The overall evidence suffers from many limitations, the most significant being the short-term exposure (\u226412 weeks) and follow-up to NRT product use in most of the studies, the common failure to account for changes in smoking behaviour following NRT use, and the sparse information on SAHEs by type of NRT product used. The only SAHE from NRT exposure we identified was an increase in respiratory congenital abnormalities reported in one study. Limited evidence indicated a lack of effect between NRT exposure and SAHEs for CVD and various reproduction/developmental endpoints. **For cancer, stroke and other SAHEs, the evidence was inadequate to demonstrate any association with NRT use**. Our conclusions agree with recent statements from authoritative bodies.\n\n\nAlthough we cannot categorically exclude the possibility that nicotine alone is a cancer causing or a cancer promoting agent with 100% certainty, we might conclude that the low level of serious adverse health effects from psychotropically effective doses in nicotine replacement therapy are a good indicator for the general safety of the [miniscule levels of nicotine][4] found in tomatoes, potatoes and even the egregious eggplant.\n\n\n\nConflicts of interest:\nThis answer does not promote or advertise or justify the use of nicotine in any way.

To summarize: yes, breathing techniques and other meditation and biofeedback methods have been shown to be effective for reducing anxiety and panic, as has been cognitive behavioral therapy.  Psychotherapy is a critical part of treatment of anxiety disorders.  Some people benefit from medications like SSRIs as well. BUT because anxiety might be a symptom of a medical condition, it's important to see a doctor to be formally diagnosed, and receive individualized treatment recommendations.*\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is, at its root, over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system.  It is when the normal human \"fight or flight\" response is extended and/or exaggerated.  Panic attacks occur when that gets stuck in a positive feedback loop.  \n\nPhysical symptoms of anxiety or panic are due to this sympathetic hyper-activation: increased heart rate, blood pressure, respirations, alertness, sensory awareness (including pain), sweating, speed of reaction, gastrointestinal upset, etc.  It helps to understand that anxiety and panic disorders develop more frequently in people who have experienced severe traumatic stressors, especially during childhood, during which their neurological system becomes conditioned to overreact.  During \"fight or flight\" much of our mental processing gets caught up in the limbic system (center of emotion) rather than engaging the frontal cortex (center of logical reasoning), which is why anxiety can impair clarity of thought, decision-making, and memory.\n\nDeep breathing, mediation, and certain biofeedback techniques can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, thereby decreasing sympathetic tone.  With practice it can interrupt even the positive feedback loop of panic.  This not only reduces the physical symptoms, it allows our frontal cortex to engage in processing input and thoughts more logically.

CGRP is part of a general inflammatory response, in turn part of the pain response associated with trigger points.   \n\n**Background**  \nPhysiologically spoken, acetylcholine (Ach) is released in the neuromuscular junction by the motorneuron to activate muscle fibers to contract through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. \n\n[Jafri (2010)][1] outlines a hypothesis why Ach responses are increased, leading to the development of trigger points*, based on the work of [Simons (2004)][2]:\n\nA *hypothetical* basis for trigger points, according to Jafri is as follows: \n\n 1. Abnormal Ach release that triggers\n 2. Increased muscle fiber tension (trigger point) that constricts blood flow causing\n 3. Local hypoxia, which disrupts mitochondrial function and low ATP, causing\n 4. Tissue stress and \n 5. Release of sensitizing substances that cause pain by activation of nociceptors and\n 6. autonomic modulation that potentiates step 1 causing more Ach release.\n\nThe ischemia/hypoxia leads to acidification and muscle injury, in turn releasing of potassium, bradykinins, cytokines, ATP, and substance P which might stimulate nociceptors in the muscle, in turn leading to the tenderness and pain observed with trigger points. Pain is mediated by depolarization of nociceptive neurons that in turn also release of **calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)**. CGRP inhibits acetylcholine esterase and upregulates the amount of acetylcholine receptors and release of acetylcholine, known as acetylcholine leakage. The result is increased acetylcholine in the nerve terminal, synaptic cleft, and increased motor endplate potentials resulting in more contraction [(Jafri, 2010)][1]. \n\nWhy is CGRP released? From what I know, the function of CGRP is largely unknown [(Russell *et al*., 2014)][3]. Its role in migraine has attracted attention, but in trigger point therapy world, it's not really elucidated as far as I can see. Moreover, Trigger Points are an established phenomenon in treatment world (physiotherapy, massage, *etc*), but scientifically their pathophysiology is based on speculations and hypotheses (educated guesses). However, tapping into CGRPs expected role in pain responses in general, I think it's safe to say that CGRP is a part of a common **inflammatory response** and neuroprotective agent, and quoting [Russel *et al* (2014)][3]: \n\n> The regulation of CGRP synthesis is still poorly understood. CGRP synthesis is known to be upregulated in models of nerve damage, such as peripheral axotomy, and it is thought that synthesis of the peptide is enhanced in tissues that are undergoing an inflammatory response []. This may be linked to local release of nerve growth factor (NGF) from cells such as macrophages and keratinocytes. NGF is vitally important for the growth of sensory nerves and for the maintenance of function of mature nerves \n\nAs we all know, inflammatory responses are necessary to fight back pathogens, but inflammatory responses are at the same time painful, and even outright damaging to the body \n\n<sub>**References**  \n**-** [Jafri, *Int Sch Res Notices* (2014); 523924][1]  \n**-** [Russell *et al*., *Physiol Rev* (2014); **94**(4): 1099\u2013142][3]  \n**-** [Simons, *J Electromyogr Kinesiol* (2004); **14**(1): 95-107][2]</sub>   \n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285362/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14759755\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187032/", "16014": "### The medical term for the natural paralysis that occurs while a person is in REM sleep \u2013 most often cited as 'official' in English \u2013 seems to be: *REM atonia*.\n\n\nThe medical condition associated with hypnagogic sleep paralysis is coded in ICD10 with G47: sleep disorders /  G47.4: (according to [German Wikipedia][1]) \u2013 or [G47.8][2] Other sleep disorders, G83.8 \"Other specified paralytic syndromes\" (according to [English Wikipedia][3]).\n\nInterestingly the German Wikipedia states that *Schlafparalyse* (=sleep paralysis) is the proper term in German to use with muscle relaxation during real sleep. \u2013\u2013 Conscious feelings of paralysis are more often described as \"[hypgnagoge Schlafl\u00e4hmung][4]\" (= hypnagogic sleep paralyss; but using only true German word components for the compound word)\n\n\n[de.Wikpedia: Schlafparalyse][1]:\n> Im Englischen wird sleep paralysis ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr die St\u00f6rung verwendet, w\u00e4hrend die nat\u00fcrliche L\u00e4hmung w\u00e4hrend des normalen Schlafes REM atonia genannt wird.   \n(In English sleep paralysis is used exclusively for the disorder, while natural paralysis during normal sleep is called REM atonia.)\n\n**REM-atonia** in [Rapid eye movement sleep][5]:\n> Organisms in REM sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. **The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.**\n\nBut it doesn't get much better:   \n**[MedicineNet \u2013\u2013 Medical Definition of Atonia, REM sleep:][6]**\n> Atonia, REM sleep: See: Sleep paralysis    \n--> Sleep paralysis: Medically, sleep paralysis is sometimes called waking paralysis, predormital (before-sleep) paralysis, postdormital (after-sleep) paralysis, and REM sleep atonia.\n\nIn [\"Unraveling the Mechanisms of REM Sleep Atonia\"][7] the phenomenon is called:\n> We agree with the commentators that determining mechanisms of **rapid eye movement (REM) sleep motor atonia** is of major scientific importance and clinical relevance.

This normal \u201cparalysis\u201d during REM known as REM atonia is altered in patients with narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis is the intrusion of the normal atonia of REM sleep into wakefulness.

The nondigestible carbohydrates are all fermented by colonic microflora into butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, with demonstrated antineoplastic (51) and anti-inflammatory actions (52,53). Furthermore, dry beans have a low glycemic index (GI), defined as the incremental area under the blood glucose curve induced by a specific carbohydrate-containing food (54), which reduces the rate of the absorption of carbohydrates and lowers the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses. A number of epidemiologic studies showed that a low-GI diet is associated with a reduced risk of CRC (55-57). Other bioactive constituents of dry beans that have anticarcinogenic properties and could potentially account for a protective effect include saponins, protease inhibitors, inositol hexaphosphate, \u03b3-tocopherol, and phytosterols (49).

This is especially important to those within the population who cannot access the shot or cannot receive it due to a preexisting medical condition. As Graham Chiu's answer points out, influenza is no joke, especially for vulnerable members of the population (such as the elderly or people with certain medical conditions).\n\nWith regards to mercury in the flu shot, the specific additive is called \"Thimerosal\". Firstly: [not all flu shots contain Thimerosal][1]. If you feel strongly about it, ask your pharmacist for a vaccine that doesn't contain Thimerosal. The additive is a [preservative][2] to prevent bacteria or fungi from growing in multi-dose vials containing the influenza vaccine.

Glanz (a pediatrician and epidemiologist respectively at Kaiser Permanente's Institute for Health Research in Denver) have this to say about the safety of vaccines:\n\n> Because vaccines are given to huge numbers of people, including healthy infants, they are held to a much higher safety standard than medications used for people who are already sick.\n\nFrom the same article:\n> The key facts [you] need to know, though, are that vaccines prevent potentially fatal diseases, that vaccines have a high degree of safety, and that their safety is constantly evaluated and reevaluated in a system operating independently from the pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines.\n\nAs a final note: in that article shared by the OP there are several scientifically unsound arguments and factual errors. I'm not going through the effort of refuting them all here. It is however worth pointing out that the presence of Thimerosal in vaccines is not a secret, and is well known among the scientific and medical community. In a **brief** search of medical literature in the medical science database *[PubMed.gov][6]* (free to the public, by the way) with the search terms \"influenza vaccine safety\" I could find no results making any claims about adverse side effects due to Thimerosal. In a database containing literally millions of independent, peer-reviewed medical scientific publications, you will be hard pressed to find any supporting the claims made in the aforementioned article shared by the OP.\n\nIn fact, this [review article][7] (where researchers summarize the results of 190 other sources on vaccine safety) had this to say on the topic of vaccine safety [paraphrased by me]:\n> - Influenza causes substantial death, suffering and socioeconomic impact worldwide.\n- Vaccination is the best defense against influenza.\n- Influenza vaccines are \"very safe\".\n- The only known side effects of influenza vaccines are temporary nasal congestion (runny nose) and sometimes allergic reactions.\n- Allergic reactions appear in less than 1 out of every 1,000,000 doses.\n- Children with asthma under the age of 2 are particularly susceptible to the side effects of the influenza vaccine and more study is required to ensure it's safety for this particular high-risk group.\n\nIn other words, infants who have problems breathing might be more significantly affected by allergic reactions or congestion. That's all they have to say about flu vaccine side effects (regardless of whether they contain Thimerosal). Finally, a direct quote from the conclusion:\n> Vaccines have to meet higher safety standards, since they are administered to healthy people, mainly healthy children. The monitoring of annual influenza vaccine safety, which is particular [sic] important on account of the annual changes in the viral antigen composition of the vaccine, constitutes a critical component of the influenza vaccination program. Indeed, not only does this strategy ensure the safety of vaccines, it can also maintain public trust in the national vaccination program.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/thimerosal.htm\n  [2]: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html\n  [3]: https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15070/12655\n  [4]: https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15074/12655\n  [5]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/straight-talk-about-vaccination/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\n  [7]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1423153", "14719": "The official stance on this 'issue' is:\n\n> **MMR vaccine side-effects**\n> (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella)\n> \n> What are the risks from MMR vaccine?\n> \n> A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems,\n> such as severe allergic reactions.\n> \n> The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely\n> small.\n> \n> Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or\n> rubella.\n> \n> Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with\n> it.\n> \n> **Mild problems**\n> \n> - Fever (up to 1 person out of 6)\n> - Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)\n> - Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)\n> \n> If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the\n> shot.

As a very, very rare reaction this is a perfectly possible secondary outcome scenario. (Meaning two things here. First: this might be caused only indirectly, because two: if you have a reaction or experience more serious [side-effects][2] it is more than likely that these performance issues are not of primary concern) \n\nAs something to base a general recommendation *against vaccination for men* this seems implausible, to say the least.

Seven other studies reported only on the use of charcoal for oral hygiene.

The heart is a pump which pushes blood into the arteries in pulsatile manner (pushes out blood with each heart beat). As the blood is pushed in the arteries, the pressure rises to a peak called systolic pressure, which is usually around 120 mm Hg. As the heart's main chamber (left ventricle) relaxes, the pressure tends to fall. But fall in pressure is arrested by closure of a valve called aortic valve. Further fall in pressure occurs by flow of blood to peripheral tissues.  The lowest limit to which the pressure falls in main arteries is called diastolic pressure and it is usually around 80 mm Hg. \n\nMorever, when the blood pressure is checked with a mercury instrument, the cuff around arm is inflated to about 200 mm Hg (to occlude the flow in artery of the arm) and then slowly pressure is reduced while listening to the sounds over artery in front of the elbow joint. Knocking sounds start coming at systolic pressure (usually around 120 mm Hg). These sounds disappear as the cuff pressure is lowered below diastolic blood pressure (usually around 80 mm Hg). Hence, the BP reading is said to be 120/80.\n\nThe following figure from the [Blood pressure Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure#Pulse_pressure) should make this clearer. The notch on the downnstroke indicates point of closure of the aortic valve.  \n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BBbY8.png\n\n---\nEdit in response to comment below: The mechanism of these sounds is not entirely clear and has been subject of study since long (see this 1929 article: http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(29)90277-5/abstract . Many theories have been proposed e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2774311 . It is likely to originate from the artery wall due to vibrations created by turbulent flow that occurs when blood flow is partially obstructed (ref: https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/cardio/auscul.htm). There is no sound when the flow is totally obstructed i.e. cuff pressure greater than systolic pressure. Also, there is no sound when cuff pressure is lower than diastolic since the flow then is laminar and not turbulent. The nature of sounds (called Korotkoff sounds) also varies as pressure is lowered from systolic to diastolic and 5 phases have been identified: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds#The_five_Korotkoff_sounds\n\nReferences:\n\n[Cardiac Cycle](http://www.cvphysiology.com/Heart%20Disease/HD002.htm)\n\n[Human Physiology/The cardiovascular system](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/The_cardiovascular_system)\n", "14550": "Apparently not.

One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation \u2014 known as contact dermatitis.\n\nI think I found the [last study mentioned](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10417589):\n\n> The results of this study show that topically applied vitamin E does not help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars and leads to a high incidence of contact dermatitis.\n>\n>  In 90% of the cases in this study, topical vitamin E either had no effect on, or actually worsened, the cosmetic appearance of scars. Of the patients studied, 33% developed a contact dermatitis to the vitamin E.

In it, scientists followed a group of 159 people who had suffered burns over the course of a year, randomly selecting some to regularly apply vitamin E to their scars and others to use a different topical cream. Those in the vitamin E group showed no noticeable improvement in the size, thickness or appearance of their scars by the end of the study.\n\nWhich seems to be [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3312212/)\n\n> One hundred fifty-nine operative procedures for postburn contractures of interdigital webs (96), the axilla (46), or the neck (17) were prospectively randomized to be treated postoperatively for four months with a topical steroid (Aristocort A), topical vitamin E, or the base cream carrier for these drugs. The nature of the medication was blinded both to the patient and to the evaluator. Patients were followed for one year. Observations were made for range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, and ultimate cosmetic appearance. No beneficial effect of either vitamin E or topical steroid could be demonstrated. However, adverse reactions occurred in 16.4% of patients receiving active drug, compared to 5.9% treated only with base cream. Interestingly, the grafts initially contracted and subsequently grew to be a size larger (about 20%) than the original graft by one year. It is concluded that neither topical steroid nor topical vitamin E is effective in reducing scar formation after grafting procedures for reconstruction for postburn contractures.\n", "14467": "There are many factors that can determine how well an individual will heal and scar. While many treatments have been suggested for the treatment of scars, only a few of them have been supported by prospective studies with an adequate control group. As a result, the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids remains an unsolved problem in the process of wound healing. An abstract titled, \u2018[The use of silicone occlusive sheeting (Sil-K) and silicone occlusive gel (Epiderm) in the prevention of hypertrophic scar formation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9810992?dopt=Abstract)' confirms,\n\n> For this reason, a successful treatment to prevent excessive scar formation still has yet to be found. \n\nTherefore, as it relates to the *effectiveness* of topical scar treatments -- there isn't one particular type that is *completely effective*. The potential for achieving results from a topical scar treatment is usually dependent on the age, thickness, and location of the scar. \n\nHowever, clinical support of topical gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the \"internationally recommended first-line form of scar management\", though there continues to be ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. '[The Use of Silicone Adhesives for Scar Reduction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486716/)' explains,\n\n> At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized.\n\nWhereas occlusion and hydration may also be achieved by other scar care products, '[An Evaluation of Evidence Regarding Application of Silicone Gel Sheeting for the Management of Hypertrophic Scars and Keloids](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2989813;jsessionid=B8FC345F5F30BF514B5D53722310AA86)' recognizes the benefits of silicone gel sheeting, stating it   \n\n> \u2026has been clinically proven to also address pruritus, skin pigmentation changes, and primary prevention...Hypertrophic and keloid scar-related physical discomfort ranging from itching to pain have been seen to improve dramatically upon SGS treatment.\n\nAdditional benefits include:\n\n> ...no skin stripping, and no painful skin or hair pulling; but another advantage also lies in the fact that...unlike alternatives, have a low viscous component that limits their flow and consequently their readiness to absorb materials at the surface of the skin such as stratum corneum cells and lipids.

Thus, using one or the other should be just as effective. The effectiveness of using one or both products will likely depend on your individual biology because (as with any therapy), individual responses and results may vary. \n\nIn conclusion, it is always in your best interest to consult with your primary care physician or dermatologist to discuss the best treatment option(s) for your specific condition and individual needs.", "14141": "Since 'the cure' or rather a vaccine against the virus is still only on the horizon, affected populations have to resort to prevention measures and supportive care, once the infection breaks out. Even with a vaccine, [mosquito population control][1] and bite prevention will be necessary to control chikungunya disease.\n\n[Chikungunya at the Door \u2014 D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu All Over Again][2]\n\n> We now face a new threat posed by the unrelated chikungunya virus, which causes a disease clinically similar to dengue in a similar epidemiologic pattern, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, and for which we also lack vaccines and specific treatments. [\u2026] Thus, the current chikungunya threat to the United States must be met primarily with standard public health approaches such as mosquito control and avoidance. In addition, there is an important role for astute clinicians in diagnosing and reporting the disease when it occurs.\n\nThe Do's include limiting the habitat and reach of the mosquitos. \nIf possible any open [still waters][3] should be [drained][4], [closed][5] or [covered][6]. Uneven spots of ground where puddles are forming after a rain should be filled with earth or other material. Wholes in a road should be fixed as soon as possible.\n\nTightly woven [screens][7] in front of doors and windows might help to keep the insects out of homes, [nets][8] around beds to keep those already in away from sleeping humans. Wearing long clothes helps to prevent the incidents of bites.\n\nInsect [repellent][9] chemicals like [DEET][10], [p-Menthane-3,8-diol][11] or [Icaridin][12] applied to the exposed skin, clothing and even parts of a house structure might help to keep them away. If those strong chemicals arr either not available, not affordable or not well tolerated by the people who should apply them, much weaker [natural repellents][13] might be worth a try. \n\nSince the disease vector is an insect, very [targeted][14] and limited usage of pesticides might be an option to consider. This is an option that has rather wide spread consequences beyond just [killing][15] the mosquitos and those might develop resistance or already are [resistant][16] to the chemicals to employed there. Most of those insecticides are not really safe for humans to use and the actual way they are used (misused, misapplied, over-dosed, under-dosed etc.) might have a net effect that's undesirable.\n\nA more humane and less environmental destructive method of [limiting][17] the number of mosquitos is to [trap][18] them. Their are two ways in principle to achieve this: either sexual stimulation with pheromones, leading the insects to sticky traps from where they do not escape. Or exploiting their [target acquisition][19] system, by presenting them [decoy][20] signals that will steer a significant number of them away from humans and animals and into the traps.\n\nSince a significant number of infections result from bites of the insects while being outside, long clothing, repellents should be among the first things to do for individuals. A number of larger scale fan traps might be worth to try in a community effort to decrease the spread of the insects and reduce the number of bites for people being outside.\n\nAlthough it is about the similar disease called Dengue fever, this guide:\n[Vector Management and Delivery of Vector Control Services][6] \u2013  and others like it \u2013 should be read  and everything in there that an individual can do should be put into action and tried as soon as possible. If any aspect in there is of a size too large for individuals these components should be addressed by the local community and even escalated to higher authorities.\n\n\n  [1]: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/1982/9241700661_eng.pdf\n  [2]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMp1408509\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnant_water\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149385/\n  [5]: http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/control_strategies/en/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143163/\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_screen\n  [8]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X09001910\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEET\n  [11]: https://doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282006%2922%5B507%3APARBMR%5D2.0.CO%3B2\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icaridin\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent#Common_natural_insect_repellents\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925229/\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_pest_management\n  [16]: http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005054\n  [17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_trap\n  [18]: https://youtu.be/VAT3Kq_w_VM\n  [19]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rovuyeXl42Y\n  [20]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNjyLRQutXs", "13865": "Why, oh, why?

Colloquially:  Hormonal imbalances, oily skin, bacterial infections and:\n> Genetics, Diet, Hormones, Stress, Comedones (plugs in pores),[\u2026]<sup>(2)</sup>\n\nOr in another systematic:\n>  Genetics, Androgens, Inflammation, Neuropeptides, Bacteria, The Acne Biofilm, Evidence Supporting a Link Between Acne and Nutrition, Smoking, Antimicrobial Peptides in Acne, Acne and Antimicrobial Lipids, Natural and Artificial Suntanning, Acne and Environmental Pollution (Chloracne), Myths and Beliefs of Acne Pathogenesis: Diet, Smoking, Hygiene, [\u2026] Drug-Induced Acne, Body-Builder Acne, Acne Cosmetica\u2026 <sup>(3)</sup>  \n\nThis multitude of causes, often found in countless variations or combinations, means that to arrive at \"The Acne Gel\" with just an anti-androgen in it is bound to fail.\n\nOnly if a condition is [really classified][12] as a androgen- or androgen-receptor [disorder][13] is there any reason to act upon this alone. Androgens are not \"bad\". Simply blocking, or yet destroying, the complete signalling pathway for that may yield quite unpleasant results. \n\n> [Both estrogens and androgens play important parts in skin and hair physiology, \\[\u2026\\]Further studies with androgen-dependent skin are required to determine whether estrogen receptor \u03b2 has a regulatory role on androgen receptor expression in the hair follicle in parallel with its role in other androgen-dependent tissues.][14]\n\n> [**Androgens affect several functions of the human skin, such as sebaceous gland growth and differentiation, hair growth, *epidermal barrier homeostasis* and wound healing.**][15] \n\n\"Just removing this one bad guy\" is just not an option.\nOr just imagine human skin without collagen, you would fall apart to see this:\n\n> [Collagen, the major macromolecular component of skin, is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the tissue as well as for providing important functional characteristics, such as pliability and thickness. We have been studying the structure and regulation of collagen in mouse mutations affecting the skin. In the course of these studies, we found that there are significant differences in collagen content between the skin of wild-type male and female mice, which become evident at puberty. Furthermore, male mice with an X-linked mutation in the androgen receptor gene (formerly called testicular feminization and abbreviated as ArTfm) showed decreased levels of collagen, indicating that the androgen receptor pathway contributes to the observed differences. These findings demonstrate that there are striking differences in the collagen content of skin between male and female mice, and provide a biochemical explanation for these differences.][16]\n\n(An important side note should be allowed in reaction to the comment below: the [odour][17] dependent an [androgens][18] that is manufactured *in* the skin is what [attracts the ladies][19] (well to a [certain extent][20], or likeminded identities), \"the [stink][21]\" [found often][22] in the same place is mainly manufactured by the bacteria *on the skin* feeding on accumulated waste there. )\n\n# Conclusion\n\"Irreversibly damaging\" anything looks like a good idea? Most of those suffering from acne in their youth stop suffering from acne in adulthood. Starting to manipulatie anyones genes without first getting a ***much*** better understanding of all the complexities of these processes \u2013in general\u2013 seems very pre-mature.\n\nWhile I am by no means an expert in guessing the path of the future, I am convinced that there are better ways to treat acne now and even better treatments \u2013 without crispering genes \u2013\u00a0will become available. If a condition within this spectrum of unpleasantness *is identified with certainty* to be influenced positively by androgen receptor sensitivity modification then a treatment doing just that (but temporarily) will come quickly.\n\n> Understanding the complex relationships that form the background for these three diseases is essential in order to provide the \u201cdeliverable\u201d<sup>(3)</sup>\n\nOf course, only funding research into overly specific directions, like genetic modification or topical anti-androgens, may have detrimental effects in the long run.

Nicotine addiction vs. inhaling combusted natural products \n 2. Cessation and the mere use of vaped products.\n\nThere should be little doubt that *not* habitually inhaling nitrosamines and aldehydes is probably better than doing so.  In the end, however, the suggestion is equivalent to \"eating boiled steak is healthier than grilled steak\" - for the very same plethora of chemicals that give flavor, but are the result of combustion - whether fine Turkish tobacco or Kobe beef.  I'll still take mine rare and blackened, please.\n\nAlso, tempering the large research cited on [Narusan-in-coma's answer](https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13714) with the thought that \"vaping\" has created a whole large group of younger people that would not otherwise \"smoke\" burning tobacco, *the ultimate effects, as Narusan-in-coma points out, are not known.*  Nor is research at all simple, as most \"vapor\" folks will not vape Frutopia Fun Blend #7 for decades, inhaling god-knows-what flavoring chemicals, with repeated long-term exposure and dosing.\n\nIt can only be concluded that the combustion products are eliminated (or reduced by magnitudes).  If *those* are considered Enemy #1, then one could make the leap to \"healthier\".  But only with that assumption in place, and forsaking all others.\n\n\"Substitution\" presumes a nicotine addiction already in place.  The health effects of nicotine addiction *by itself* (without combustion and environmental factors) have not been proven or even justified well in my mind.  In fact, tests in rats have shown that nicotine alone may not be addictive at all.  Which right or wrong proves *nothing*.\n\nI worked for many years with a renown DABT toxicologist, building devices to smoke cigarettes in a precise way, and deliver \"precision\" cigarette smoke to lab animals like rodents and lagomorphs.  Not just for \"cancer\" type research, but psychology and performance physiology studies as well.  In fact, the nicotine and tar content have to be measured constantly and accurately by tobacco companies, for the required labeling, since tobacco is a natural product and can vary from season to season.

You appear to be asking about **monozygotic** (\u201cidentical\u201d) twinning given the reference to \u201csplitting the egg.\u201d  I will provide a brief overview of both.\n\n**Types of multiple conceptions and relationship to IVF**\n\n**Dizygotic** (\"fraternal\") twins (and higher multiples) occur because more than one egg is fertilized. This is very common during the in vitro process because the ovaries are stimulated using medications, as opposed to the normal menstrual cycle where usually only one egg is release. Because multiple birth pregnancies have considerably higher rates of both maternal and fetal complications,<sup>1</sup>  IVF centers and mothers together have to make a decision weighing the risk of multiple embryo transfer with the benefits of improved probability of successful live birth. In some countries, there are laws against transferring more than one embryo, but in the United States this varies by center, and overall about 35 percent of IVF pregnancies are twins, with 7-8 % being triplets.<sup>2</sup> \n\n**Monozygotic** (\"identical\") twins occur because an early embryo divides after fertilization. This results in two embryos with identical DNA (hence the terminology and phenotype - \u201cidentical\u201d). These have also been shown to be more common in IVF pregnancies, although the degree of over-representation is considerably less marked compared to the situation with dizygotes. The mechanism is also less clear. \n\n**Is this desirable?**  \nMonozygotic twins (and higher multiples) have markedly increased rates of every pattern of fetal and perinatal mortality, overall between four and seven times the rate compared to singletons.<sup>3</sup> This may be in part due to the fact that the process of splitting is itself a \u201cdeformity\u201d of sorts that tends to cluster with other deformities. It is also the case that monozygotic multiple births at times share, to varies degrees, portions of the placental sac (*mono-chorionic* and at times also *mono-amniotic*). Mono-amniotic are susceptible to umbilical cord entanglement, which can lead to serious complications. Those that do not share an amniotic sac (*mono-chorionic*, *di-amniotic*) are susceptible to something called Twin-twin Transfusion Syndrome wherein blood is shunted from one twin to the other via vascular connections between the placentas. This can lead to severe anemia of the \u201cdonor\u201d twin and polycythemia (overload of red blood cells) in the \u201crecipient\u201d, both of which carry complications.<sup>3</sup> \n\nYou asked: \n> can (we) ask the IVF clinic to split the eggs before insertion?\n\nYour goal appears to to increase the chance of monozygotic twinning.  Although it has been shown<sup>3</sup>  that certain factors do increase this chance (advanced maternal age and some technical considerations during the fertilization step), because of the above considerations about complications during monozygotic multiple embryo pregnancies, this is considered an *undesirable* outcome during IVF. As such, IVF centers are unlikely to do anything likely to increase this chance.\n\n\n\n1. Seoud MA, Toner JP, Kruithoff C, Muasher SJ.

This means that if the patient takes the pills religiously, their menstrual cycles will be regular, with their period happening exactly when specified by the pills. PCOS is a complex disease with many underlying factors, including genetics and lifestyle (e.g. obesity). Many of its symptoms, including acne and irregular periods, can be controlled by birth control pills, but the underlying genetic issues will still be present and often the underlying lifestyle issues will still be present. Therefore, when a patient with birth control pills stops taking the pills, if they have not done anything else in their life to reduce their PCOS, it is likely that their former symptoms will return. This means if they previously had irregular periods they will probably get irregular periods again. \n\nThe exception would be if they have made some kind of lifestyle change to reduce their PCOS, such as losing weight. Weight loss can normalize hormone levels and help with PCOS symptoms (e.g. \"most treatments of obesity...achieve modest reductions in weight and improvements in PCOS phenotype\", see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649566/). Weight loss can sometimes restore fertility in PCOS patients who have lower fertility due to PCOS.\n\nHere's my personal experience: I had PCOS, diagnosed by an endocrinologist via an ovarian ultrasound, clinical history, and blood tests. My periods were EXTREMELY irregular. I had a normal BMI but it was on the \"high side\" of normal. I learned in medical school about how PCOS is tied in with sugar consumption (high sugar consumption -> high insulin -> higher androgens -> worse PCOS, e.g. http://imaging.ubmmedica.com/CME/pt/content/p010531a.gif). I also learned that consequently PCOS is sometimes treated with metformin, a diabetes drug. Instead of taking a drug, I eliminated white and brown sugar from my diet and limited myself to an appropriate number of calories per day. I also exercise for an hour a day. Consequently, I lost 25 pounds (current BMI = 20, which is low end of normal) and my PCOS symptoms have entirely vanished: I have clockwork periods, and a recent ultrasound of my ovaries showed no cysts, so I no longer meet ANY of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Because I have \"cured\" my PCOS through lifestyle changes, as long as I continue the lifestyle changes I am \"cured\" of PCOS. In contrast, I know someone who is taking birth control pills to hide their PCOS symptoms, and if they stop taking the pills their symptoms do come back. Note - everyone is physiologically unique, and so people respond to lifestyle changes to a different degree. Diet and exercise are great, but may not always \"cure\" someone - the best resource is to talk to your own physician.

[**Vasocongestion**][4], (temporary fluid congestion) as mentioned in the link provided in the Wikipedia article, is required for erection in men and clitoral arousal in women.  It is the increase in blood and pressure in the relevant body parts.\n\n 2. **Blue balls** is a slang term and has no official term which I have been able to find.  The Wikipedia article says that some urologists call it **epididymal hypertension**, however, researching a bit more, [one article in the journal *Pediatrics*, published in 2000][5], discussed \"epididymal hypertension\" as a potential diagnosis in young adult males.  The problem is that \"epididymal hypertension\" is a diagnosis which is a general, *all encompasing* diagnosis for all sorts of causes of testicular pain.\n\n> The condition described, what the urologists often term \u201cepididymal hypertension,\u201d and some have labeled \u201cdeadly sperm buildup\u201d or \u201cDSB,\u201d has many other manifestations of which physicians and their caretakers ought to be aware. ([Rockney & Alario, 2001][6])\n\n[another article][7] states the fact that\n> The medical community hasn't spent a ton of time on this particular phenomenon. For one thing, it is absolutely non life-threatening, despite the belief otherwise by many a first time sufferer. Plus, any topic even suggesting sexuality among the sub voting aged crowd is politically charged and uncomfortable for many healthcare providers to broach with either their patients or their patients' parents (especially the moms).\n>\nWorse yet, the immediate relief of the pain is most efficiently handled by the immediate release of the arousal. The easiest way to do this, of course, is through orgasm.\n\n 3. Boys and men will often wake up with an erection in the morning, with or without stimulation or erotic dreams.  These erections are sometimes referred to as \"morning wood\" or \"morning glory\".\n\nWhether the erection was nocturnal or not, [the easiest (and quickest) treatment for this is ejaculation][8].

Semen volume, proportion of normal sperm morphology, neutral \u03b1-glucosidase, prostate-specific antigen, zinc, and fructose did not differ significantly between groups. [Therefore] results demonstrate superior semen quality in samples collected by masturbation at home compared with at a clinic. This should be taken into consideration in infertility investigations.\n\n<h2>Male Masturbation</h2>\n\nSince sperm are short-lived, they must constantly be replenished, so [the testes produce 1,500 sperm per second][3]. Plus sperm is produced during the whole of the male life. If the dead sperm is not released through sex or masturbation, it will automatically be released by the body.\n\nSome males find that they are more prone to [nocturnal emissions][4] during times of less frequent sexual activity because they are not ejaculating as frequently from masturbation or sex with a partner, and in fact \u2014 as @Gabri pointed out, and studies have confirmed \u2014 high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer [(Leitzmann, et al., 2004)][5].\n\n<h2>Female Masturbation</h2>\n\nThere is even less around for female masturbation, but one study suggests that female orgasm induces ovulation [(Pavli\u010dev, and Wagner, 2016)][6] so that would suggest that the chances of conception would be higher.  The difference between men and women is that [there is only a finite amount of eggs][7].  The human female has all their eggs at birth and no more is being produced. Once they are all released, that's it.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\nColeman, E.

These are sudden seizures, generally experienced by young children, resulting from an especially high fever. The generally accepted (although not fully confirmed) mechanism is via something called [*respiratory alkalosis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_alkalosis) (see e.g. [Mazarati (2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797883/)). Hyperthermia, among other processes<sup>1</sup>, triggers an imbalance in blood pH and pCO<sub>2</sub>, which in turn can increase brain activity, leading to a seizure. Children (generally below the age of six) are especially vulnerable.\n\nWith that in mind, it would make sense that heat could be a possible seizure trigger. That said, there are some things to bear in mind. First, children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have a seizure again; these seizures are generally not linked to epilepsy, although a family history of seizures may contribute to this. Therefore, there are two questions to ask: Can heat stroke cause seizures, and is this more prevalent for people with epilepsy?\n\nWe also need to consider that instances of heat stroke can be quite different. Often, it is convenient to divide cases into two categories: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), and non-exertional/classical heat stroke (NEHS/CHS). [*Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017*](https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ) gives a rather nice comparison on page 551. There are a few differences that pertain to our case, some of which I've copied here:\n\n    Patient Characteristics |     Classic     | Exertional \n    --------------------------------------------------------\n    Age                     | Young children/ |  15-55 yr\n                            |   the elderly   |\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n    Fever                   |     Unusual     |   Common\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n    Activity                |    Sedentary    |  Strenuous\n                            |                 |   exercise\n    --------------------------------------------------------\n    Acid-base disturbances  |   Respiratory   |   Lactic\n                            |    alkalosis    |  acidosis\n\nNotice that respiratory alkalosis is described as more common classic heat stroke, which afflicts children, whereas [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis) is more prevalent in exertional heat stroke. Interestingly enough, I haven't been able to find any information on the latter *causing* seizures, although I have seen references indicating it can arise as a byproduct of seizures, especially tonic-clonic (\"grand mal\") seizures.\n\nIt is, of course, well-known that heat stroke can trigger once-off seizures in people, often including small children (which should be apparent from some of the above). This has been well-studied in, of all creatures, dogs, which have unfortunately high mortality relates, often from being left trapped in a car or other area which rapidly becomes very hot. [One book](https://books.google.com/books?id=zeEqDQAAQBAJ) states that an astonishing *35%* of dogs who suffer from heat stroke experience seizures in the process; [this may arise from cerebral edema](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3074&context=iowastate_veterinarian) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema)) or something else. I don't have comparable statistics for humans (I assume the mortality rates are better than the 50%+ I've seen quote for dogs), but it's clear that heat stroke can, and often will, cause seizures.\n\nAgain, though, these seizures - like febrile seizures - generally do not recur. They are distinct and separate from epileptic seizures. Therefore, our second question is still unanswered.\n\n[Countless](http://www.epilepsy.com/connect/forums/living-epilepsy-adults/overheating-seizure-trigger) [forums](http://www.coping-with-epilepsy.com/forums/f23/heat-sensitivity-3790/) (why people use all caps is beyond me) are full of stories of people with epilepsy suffering seizures purportedly due to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, or something similar. I'm assuming these are cases of exertional heat stroke. However, *these seizures are not necessarily caused by epilepsy*. They may be entirely coincidental. A person with epilepsy may have a seizure brought on by something unrelated to the primary cause of their epilepsy.\n\nThere are some exceptions - but they occur predominantly in children. I stated before that children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have another. This is true, but there are underlying conditions which may produce febrile seizures repeatedly, or, rather, make it more likely for heat-related seizures to occur. Two important ones are [Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy_with_febrile_seizures_plus) and [Dravet syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravet_syndrome), also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI). The latter may be regarded as a special case of the former. Both are genetic, caused by mutations in the [SCN1A gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nav1.1); they may or may not be inheritable.\n\nEssentially, mutations in SCN1A (or perhaps another gene) occasionally inhibits [sodium channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel) from working properly, which in term can lead to a seizure. The links between high temperatures and the channels are more tenuous, though [Sun et al. (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel) have suggested that in cases of GEFS+, heat may impact the voltage across the channels, further impacting their ability to properly function (see also [Oakley et al. (2008)](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/10/3994.full.pdf), studying mice with Dravet Syndrome).\n\nIn conclusion, then, it appears that\n\n 1. Heat stroke can indeed cause seizures, especially in children and small animals. Fevers can have the same effects, and may be more severe. However, all of these seizures are normally one-time events.\n 2. There *are* underlying diseases which result in epilepsy with heat sensitivity. Repeated febrile seizures may arise as a result. However, these are usually - though not always - limited to young children. Most people with epilepsy likely do not have to worry about being \"triggered\" by heat much more than most people do.\n\nI do think that an appropriate analogy to draw here is with photosensitive epilepsy, as you did. While rapidly flashing lights *can* lead to a seizure, this is generally limited to a subset of those with epilepsy.\n\n---\n<sup>1 Hyperventilation is another possible seizure trigger, acting via a similar mechanism. I'm guessing you're more familiar with it.</sup>", "10946": "If the weapon is still in the wound : don't touch anything and call the appropriate emergency system (varies from country to country).\n>Never attempt to remove any penetrating object still in situ as this may cause more serious bleeding\n\nIf the wound is open, apply **little** pressure on it with clean clothes.

Then, one day you increase salt intake to 10 grams per day. This [may or may not result in **water retention,**][1] which will develop fully within few days and become stable at a certain level, so on the end you will have, for example, 2 liters more water in your body than before.\n\nAnother thing is, that your body wants to maintain blood sodium at a certain level, so your kidneys will excrete the extra sodium. Since the kidneys can excrete sodium only together with a certain amount of water, you will also **[excrete more water (urine)][2].** Also, with increased salt intake you probably drink more water, which you will again need to excrete (urinate more).\n\n**In conclusion:** After an increase of salt intake, water retention will occur as a single event developing to its highest level within few days and than stabilize.

But I will try to address some of your concerns:*\n\n\n**What are arachnoid cysts?**\n\nArachnoid cysts (AC) are a collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the arachnoid membrane. The CSF is produced by the arachnoid cells which line the cyst. The exact mechanism by which those cyst appear and grow is still not clear. The current main theories are passive diffusion of CSF into the cyst or progressive entrapment due to a ball valve effect. The image below (from http://weillcornellbrainandspine.org/sites/default/files/arachnoid-cyst-pediatric-lg.jpg) shows you an arachnoid cyst (the structure in red).\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\n**How frequent are those arachnoid cysts?**\n\nArachnoid cysts represent 1% of intracranial masses. In a retrospective study conducted among adult brain MRI, the prevalence of arachnoid cyst was 1.4 percent; of these, only 5 percent were symptomatic. Symptomatic arachnoid cysts are more frequent in children (75 percent of symptomatic arachnoid cysts occur in children)\n\n**What are the symptoms associated with arachnoid cysts?**\n\n*Symptoms depend on the location of those cyst as well as their size.*\n\nMost of those cysts (approximatively 50%) arise in the Sylvian fissure (so approximatively in the same region as your sister\u2019s AC), although they may occur in any part of the nervous system where there is arachnoid. Other common sites include: cerebral convexity, interhemispheric fissure, suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal cistern, cerebellopontine angle, midline of the posterior fossa, and the spine. \n\nCysts in the Sylvian fissure are usually asymptomatic but can present with headache, seizure and less commonly, focal neurological deficits. Subdural hematomas may occur following relatively minor head trauma.\n\n**What is the treatment for arachnoid cysts?**\n\nTreatment is generally initiated if patients have symptoms. If mainly asymptomatic, current recommendations recommend serial imaging and neurologic examinations (as suggested by your neurologist). \nIn general, surgery is indicated if patients suffer from symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal neurologic deficits (= motor or sensory problems in face, limbs) or cognitive impairment. Needle aspiration usually is of temporary benefit and is not a good long-term treatment option .\n\n*Your sister has also a retention cyst in the maxillary sinus.*\n\nAccording to Wang et al [1][2], who followed 40 patients with retention cysts,\n\n> Most retention cysts of the maxillary sinus spontaneously regressed or\n> showed no significant change in size over the long term.

But here the focus is on weight loss and improved blood sugar levels, which are not relevant health indicators for people who are healthy to begin with.\n\nGeneral arguments for a carb based low fat diet are given [here][2].\nThe evidence for benefits w.r.t cardiovascular disease is presented [here][3].\n\nThe basic point made in these more general and less rigorous arguments is that a natural diet for humans is a plat based diet, all the fats in our diets should then come from the plants we eat. Oils are refined calories with low nutritional value, they should be avoided. We are genetically adapted to live on such a diet where the calories from fats will be of the order of 10%.\n\nIf you then put this to the test, study populations who live on such a diet and consider the health of the population, the fraction of the population who are obese, suffer from diabetes, heart disease etc. then what you find is that these levels are not a factor 2 lower, not a factor 10 lower, but typically more than a factor 100 lower.

They cited reports from other studies indicating relatively low meat and fat intakes (\u223c16\u201320 g a day) in the African communities, with possibly up to 40 g fat a day in more well-to-do families. With estimated intake of 2000 calories per day, this would be \u223c10\u201320% of total caloric intake. In contrast, though Asian communities comprised Hindus who were largely lacto-ovo-vegetarians, and Muslims who had meat, fish and poultry in their diets, it was estimated that fat and oils provided a large proportion, \u223c30\u201340%, of total caloric intake in the Asian community, whatever the religious or dietary group.\n\nSuch results have been replicated in many other studies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic illness - meaning that it cannot be completely cured. There are, however, various therapeutic options for patients suffering from MS. Some of them include chemotherapeutics - but not as the first-line treatment.\n\nThe important thing to understand is that there are many forms of MS, which can roughly be categorised in four groups:\n\n 1. Relapsing - remitting (RR)\n 2. Primary progressive\n 3. Progressive relapsing\n 4. Secondary progressive\n\nSeverity, clinical manifestations and treatment options differ across these types. The most common type is RR. \n______________________________________________\n\nRR therapeutic approach\n----\nFor RR there are two sorts of treatment:\n\n 1. Treatment in an acute [relapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse), where short-term corticosteroid treatment is used to stop the attack\n 2. Disease modifying treatment - which is used regularly in order to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, and improve prognosis.\n\nIt is the second group, where chemotherapy can be used, but, as mentioned above not as a first-line treatment. This means that other therapeutic options should be tried first. These are predominantly glatiramer acetate or interferon beta. If they don't work some other medicines are considered. Only if they don't work either, the next option is using chemotherapeutic agents.\n______________________________________________\n\nHow would a chemotherapeutic work in MS?\n----\n\nThere are, again two approaches. The first one is to use these medicines, at lower doses than to treat cancer, to suppress the immune system. Since MS is an autoimmune disease, immune suppression reduces the inflammation and damage to the myelin sheet. Another approach is to use these medicines to ablate the immune system prior to autologous stem cell transplant, where the patient's bone marrow is replaced with their stem cells. This line of treatment is, however, still in experimental phase and has not been approved. There are many complications, difficulties and side-effects of this procedure, and thus far the risks outweigh the benefits. \n___________________________________________\n\nExamples\n-----\n\nSome sorts of chemotherapeutic agents that have been used or tested for MS:\n\n- Cladribine has been tested for MS and even approved in some countries, but after it was rejected by the FDA and EMeA on the basis of lacking evidence for benefits outweighing the risks, the manufacturer stopped marketing applications, since new clinical trials would be costly. \n\n- Cyclophosphamide has also been investigated. Efficacy in aggressive form of disease was reported, but so were some serious adverse effects. Further research in necessary, and official guidelines, such as those by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) do not recommend use of cyclophosphamide in MS treatment. \n\n- Methotrexate has shown no significant efficacy in primary progressive MS, and was less effective than interferon beta in RR.\n______________________________________\n\nReferences:\n\n<sub>[Drug Therapies for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis](https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/TR0004_RRMS_PiB_e.pdf)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Recommendations for Drug Therapies for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis](https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/TR0004_RRMS_RecsReport_TR_e.pdf)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Multiple Sclerosis: A Primary Care Perspective](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/1101/p644.html)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Treatment Optimization in MS: Canadian MS Working Group Updated Recommendations](http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FCJN%2FCJN40_03%2FS0317167100014244a.pdf&code=d511780b3c65cd6bb38b329bcd41b762)</sub>\n\n<sub>[A Placebo-Controlled Trial of Oral Cladribine for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0902533)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Merck: Regulatory Update on Cladribine Tablets](http://www.merckgroup.com/en/media/extNewsDetail.html?newsId=DAA395BF12E226E6C12578B6007430DB&newsType=1)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Interventions affecting disease progression: cyclophosphamide should not be used in patients with multiple sclerosis (because research evidence does not show beneficial effects on the course of the condition).](https://www.nice.org.uk/donotdo/interventions-affecting-disease-progression-cyclophosphamide-should-not-be-used-in-patients-with-multiple-sclerosis-because-research-evidence-does-not-show-beneficial-effects-on-the-course-of-the)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Effects of low dose methotrexate on relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in comparison to Interferon \u03b2-1\u03b1: A randomized controlled trial](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3214348/)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Methotrexate for multiple sclerosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15106195)</sub>\n\n<sub>[Hematopoietic stem cell therapy for multiple sclerosis: top 10 lessons learned.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23192675)</sub>\n\n ", "4333": "The most severe health risk from frequent alcohol consumption are liver damage and malnutrition.

Stable angina might develop into unstable angina, which can be one of the first signs of a heart attack ([What is angina?][1]) \n\n**Stable angina**\n\n> Long-term prognosis for those with stable angina is variable, with mortality rates of between 0.9%\u2013 6.5% per annum\n\n[The management of stable angina][2]\n\nSince patients with angina are often older and already in bad health, these numbers *might* even be the same or close to the \"normal\" death rate.

Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in response to the absence of light. The pineal gland itself does not contain light receptors, but it received information indirectly: the retino-hypothalamic tract sends the information from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. From there, the information is sent to the intermediolateral column of the spine cord, where there are synapses with pre-ganglionic neurons which also synapse with post-ganglionic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion.

Since lactate is a relatively strong acid, it results in a decreased pH (an increase in free hydrogen ions, or H+) of the blood. This is called [lactic acidosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis).\n\nNormally, H+ in the blood is efficiently handled by a [buffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution), [bicarbonate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffering_system).\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nThe direction of the equation in the case of acidosis is driven to the left by the concentration of hydrogen ions. Normally, the CO<sub>2</sub> that is formed is simply exhaled by increasing the respiratory rate. This decreases the H* concentration and is called compensatory [respiratory alkalosis](http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Introduction_to_Acid_Base_disorders.html).\n\nThere is respiratory compensation whereby the body increases breathing to expel H+ in the form of CO2. \n\nIn the presence of excess H+, the body tries to compensate metabolically by increasing HCO<sub>3</sub>-, which takes time. With continued exercise, the body cannot 'make' enough HCO<sub>3</sub>- to handle all the H+, and the blood's pH falls.\n\nThis is the situation which results in nausea and vomiting if serious enough.\n\n<sub>[Introduction to Acid-Base Disorders](http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Introduction_to_Acid_Base_disorders.html) <- click through</sub>  \n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZy6Y.png", "849": "The two numbers indicate different amounts of pressure (measured in millimeters of mercury) in the arteries at different times in the cardiac cycle.

It is characterised by physical and intellectual developmental problems in the fetus, primarily with language and communication. \n\nTeratogenicity\n--------------\n\nThe general term for a drug that causes adverse developmental effects on a fetus is a [teratogen][2]. It is thought that the teratogenicity of valproic acid is due to its action on folate (folic acid) metabolism. The risk of FVS is greatest when it is used in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThe drug is also known to increase the risk of neural tube defects like spina bifida and also autism spectrum disorder ([Christensen et al, 2013][3]).

The conversion rate is highest for fats and lowest for proteins and may greatly depend on genetics.\n\n**1) What is the conversion rate for energy in macronutrients consumed to energy in fat stored?**\n\nIt depends *greatly* on a person and foods eaten, because some energy will:\n\n - not be absorbed in the intestine, [probably <5%][1]\n - be lost due to increased metabolism associated with the thermic effect of food, [in general: ~10%][2]\n - be used to increase of lean body mass, which depends on the extent of physical activity\n - be used differently in different persons, which may be genetically determined:\n\n> In response to 84 days of 1000 kcal/day of overfeeding, 12 pairs of\n> monozygotic twins gained on average 8.1 kg, but the range was from 4.3\n> to 13.3 kg.\n>\n> However, the similarity within each twin pair in response to\n> overfeeding was significant with respect to body weight gain,\n> percentage of fat and total fat mass with about three times more\n> variance among pairs than within pairs.  *([International Journal of Obesity, 2008][3]).*\n\n**2) Does the efficiency differ for the different macronutrients?**\n\nDifferent macronutrients have different thermic effects, that is the loss of consumed energy due to increased metabolism triggered by food: protein: 15-30% ; alcohol: 10-30% ; carbohydrates: 5-10% ; fat 0-3% ([Nutrition and Metabolism, 2004][2]), so calories from proteins and alcohol should be less fattening than those from fats and carbohydrates:\n\n> In conclusion, it is evident that overfeeding on carbohydrate and/or\n> fat results in body composition alterations that are different than\n> overfeeding on protein.

I.e. is the available energy in one gram of stored body fat typically equivalent to one gram of fat eaten?**\n\nIn healthy individuals, significant amounts of ketones are created only in ketogenic (low-carb) diets ([Harvard Medical School][5]). Some ketones are lost with urine and breath, but not in the amounts meaningful for weight loss ([Allinahealth][6]). According to studies, ketogenic diets may not be more efficient for weight loss than other diets ([Canadian Family Physician, 2018][7]).\n\nAs explained above, 1 g of fat eaten does not result in 1 g of fat stored, but not much less, because of low thermic effect of fat.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218769/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC524030/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897177/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786199/\n  [5]: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-try-the-keto-diet\n  [6]: https://account.allinahealth.org/library/content/1/3585\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371871/", "19982": "[Magnetic Resonance Imaging][1] is an umbrella term for any medical imaging technique that makes use of the phenomenon of [nuclear magnetic resonance][2]. There are many variants depending on how the scanner is configured and analysed, but all are considered MRI.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**The basis for the different types of MRI scanning**\n\nMuch of the following is adapted from [MRI Basics][3].\n\nEssentially, the protons in hydrogen atoms in the water that constitutes your body are sensitive to magnetic fields and align when placed in a very powerful magnetic field. Short bursts of radio waves knock them out of alignment. When the protons realign, they emit radio waves again, which is what is detected by the scanner. This frequency data is processed using a [Fourier transform][4] to get the relative intensity at each point in the plane.\n\nDifferent variations are possible by altering the frequency and timing of the radio energy pulses applied. This gives various sequences such as *T1-weighted*, *T2-weighted*, *Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (Flair)* and *diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), which differentiates tissues based on the movement of water*. Each is better at evaluating a particular type of body tissue, distinguishing between certain adjacent tissues or detecting a disease process such as inflammation.\n\nThis image shows how the brain would appear under T1, T2 and FLAIR sequences.\n\n[![MRI of brain showing T1, T2 and FLAIR sequences][5]][5]\n\n[Gadolinium][6] can be used as a contrast medium, particularly to identify vascular structures. Unlike the radiopaque contrast needed for certain types of plain x-ray or CT, gadolinium (when chelated) is [paramagnetic][7].\n\n**Types of scanning procedures**\n\nThere are many types of MRI scan, depending on the anatomical area under investigation and the configuration of the scanner, as detailed above. Here are some examples:\n\n\n - Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) - using MRI to identify the course and potency of blood vessels.\n\n - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) - used to investigate the biliary tree and pancreas (less invasive than the endoscopic alternative, an [ERCP][8]).\n\n - [Cardiac MRI][9] - imaging the heart requires pulsed sequences synchronised the the patient's ECG.\n\n - [Functional MRI][10] (fMRI) - this depicts changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration due to modulation of neural metabolism. It is used to identify metabolically active areas of the brain, as opposed to investigating anatomical pathology. It has been used for studies in neuroscience, surgical planning, for monitoring treatment outcomes.\n\n - [Magnetic resonance neurography][11] (MRN) - as mentioned in the question, this is an adapted form that is especially good at distinguishing nerves from surrounding tissue by optimising the configuration for the water properties of nerves. This was initially an adapted form of diffusion-weighted imaging that is configured to focus on the fact that water tends to diffuse *anisotropically* in nerves (it diffuses more prominently in the longitudinal axis, along the length of the nerve). It has been found to be a useful adjunct to other means of assessing peripheral nerves such as nerve conjunction studies and electromyography. See [this study][12].\n\nHere is an example image of a magnetic resonance neurography study. It demonstrates the [brachial plexus][13].\n\n[![MRN of brachial plexus][14]][14]\n\nIt is likely that an MRN will be done if a nerve needs to be directly assessed (e.g. checking for a specific nerve injury like a nerve root compression of the spine ([radiculopathy][15]) or [carpal tunnel syndrome][16]). MRN would not automatically be performed when imaging a body area for other reasons (e.g. MRI of chest for lung disease etc). It should be clear on the radiologist's report which sequences and configuration were used.\n\n\n----------\n\nIn summary, the term MRI covers all types of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. MRN is one example.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mri-scan/\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance\n  [3]: https://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/Web%20Neurorad/MRI%20Basics.htm\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQ8eu.jpg\n  [6]: https://www.insideradiology.com.au/gadolinium-contrast-medium/\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism\n  [8]: https://www.sages.org/publications/patient-information/patient-information-for-ercp-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangio-pancreatography-from-sages/\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118531\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073717/\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_neurography\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19663545\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus\n  [14]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOIba.jpg\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiculopathy\n  [16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome", "229": "### Marijuana as medicine\n\nIts usage in modern times is controversial, however studies of chemicals in the plant ([cannabinoids][1] such as [THC][2], [CBD][3]) has lead to two FDA-approved medications and more research may lead to more medications.\n\nMarinol which has been approved by FDA is used for the treatment of anorexia in HIV/AIDS patients as well as for nausea and vomiting of patients undergoing chemotherapy<sup>[wiki][4]</sup>.\n\nTHC increases appetite and reduces nausea.

The federal government funded research was carried by [NIDA][6] and the publication admits that cannabis has medicinal value<sup>[2014][5]</sup>:\n\n> Recent animal studies have shown that marijuana can kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others.\n>\n> Evidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from whole-plant marijuana can shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumors.\n>\n> Research in mice showed that these extracts, when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.\n\nThe U.S. Food and FDA conducted studies to determine the benefits and risks, however not recognized or approved marijuana plant as medicine for cancer, because researchers did not conducted enough large-scale clinical trials which showed the health benefits.\n\nA molecular biologist from Spain, Dr. Christina Sanchez explains has been studying the anti-tumor effects of THC for over a decade and she explains how it kills cancer cells entirely. See the [video][7] for more details.\n\n### Health benefits\n\nOther potential health benefits can include:\n\n- Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants.\n\n\n  Patent [US6630507][8] by 3 scientists from the Department of Health and Human Services which describe in abstract:\n\n    > Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. **The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia.** Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.\n\n- Nonpsychoactive CBD anti-tumor activity.\n\n    Study published in the journal [Molecular Cancer Therapeutics][9] state that cannabis having anti-tumor effects and found it could be the answer to the increasing number of treatment-resistant cancers.\n\n  Italian researchers published a study in [The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics][10] which tested cannabidiol on human brain tumor cells and they've found that the non-psychoactive cannabis compound to have detrimental effects on the viability of these cells, inhibiting their growth \u201csignificantly\u201d.\n\n- Antiproliferative action on brain tumour cells.\n\n  A study found in the [British Journal of Cancer][11] found that THC and other cannabinoids were able to inhibit the growth of brain tumors. In two out of nine patients, the compounds were able to decrease the number of tumor cells, all without psychoactive effects.\n\n\n- The cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.\n\n  [The Journal of Neuroscience][12] contains another study from 2001 in which THC-treated rats received neuro-protective benefits. Neuro-degeneration refers to progressively worsening brain function commonly found in age-related dementia but also when the brain is damaged. The researchers found that rats treated with THC were protected against such damage, indicating it as a potential solution for slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease and also acute damage that could occur as a result of directed tumor treatment.\n\n\n- Antibacterial effects of cannabinoids\n\n  A 2008 [study][13] led by Appendino et al. demonstrated that cannabinoids have antibacterial activity even on MRSA. They stated that: \n\n> All five major cannabinoids (cannabidiol (1b), cannabichromene (2), cannabigerol (3b), Delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (4b), and cannabinol (5)) showed potent activity against a variety of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains of current clinical relevance.\n\n----------\n\nAs a side note, in Hindu texts cannabis was known as \u2018sacred grass\u2019.

In a study of 22 immunocompromised blood and marrow transplant recipients who were hospitalized with rhinovirus infections, 7 (32%) developed fatal pneumonia. The remaining patients had infections confined to the upper respiratory tract. In 6 of the 7 fatal cases, rhinovirus had been isolated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or an endotracheal aspirate before death.\n\nNote that this is in hospitalised patients; it says nothing of non-hospitalised patients.\n\nThis conclusion has been disputed according to @anongoodnurse, but it can be seen to corroborate Greenburg's 2003 study.\n\nIn a slightly larger study by [Murali et al. (2009)][3] among people with hematological cancers:\n\n>Respiratory viral pathogens are a common cause of *morbidity* in patients with hematologic malignancies. ...Both a rapid viral culture with direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) staining and a PCR-based assay (MultiCode-PLx Respiratory Virus Panel) were performed on patients with hematologic malignancies, who underwent collection of a nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage from October 2006 to April 2007. Eighty-two samples from 70 patients were obtained; **all patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms.** Respiratory viruses were detected in 10 samples (12%) by conventional virological methods and in 31 samples (38%) by the MultiCode-PLx assay. ...40% of these patients had pneumonia in addition to the upper respiratory tract symptoms. [emphasis added]\n\n@anongoodnurse noted that there is no mention of mortality, but that does not mean a proportion didn't die from pneumonia, just like [Greenberg (2003)][2] may have found that those with pneumonia had upper respiratory tract infections.  He may have just not mentioned it in light of the fact that he wanted to highlight the mortality rate of pneumonia in his cases.  \n\n@anongoodnurse summarised by saying\n>So long story short, they have stuffy, runny noses, sore throat, cough, etc. Clearly the virus itself causes damage to the mucosa; that is integral to viral replication. After entering a mucosal cell, the virus replicates, then the progeny virus is released by lysis of the cell. This damage itself causes inflammation (not the same as an immune reaction), pain, etc. The major difference seems to be a more severe and prolonged experience.\n\nfor which I would add that fatal pneumonia **can** develop from the prolonged infection of rhinovirus.\n\n>Rhinovirus infections, although usually limited to the upper respiratory tract, can extend beyond the oropharynx and may cause complications in the lower respiratory tract, including pneumonia ([Imakita, et al. 2000][4]).\n\n## References\n\nBowden, R.

Doing that daily is bad.\nA relative recent study amassed a huge dataset and concluded that the only safe amount of alcohol is zero. This got even published in The Lancet as \n\n> [\"Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990\u20132016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016\"][1] \n\nThe key findings are communicated in the extreme, globally, and badly:\n\n> Analysing data from 15 to 95-year-olds, the researchers compared people who did not drink at all with those who had one alcoholic drink a day.   \n> They found that out of 100,000 non-drinkers, 914 would develop an alcohol-related health problem such as cancer or suffer an injury.    \n> But an extra four people would be affected if they drank one alcoholic drink a day.     \n> For people who had two alcoholic drinks a day, 63 more developed a condition within a year and for those who consumed five drinks every day, there was an increase of 338 people, who developed a health problem.\n\nThat is from a baseline of 914 problems in 100000 people an increase to 918 people in 100000 for one drink a day. As one can see, problems usually related to alcohol develop in 914 non-drinkers already or as well and one drink a day means trouble for an additional 4 people.\n\nIs much or not? If that is difficult to picture mentally, The Lancet provides you the service of a picture that gets overlooked in the sensationalist press:\n> [![enter image description here][2]][2]\n\nThe relative risk increase \u2013 in a study that claims zero is the only safe level \u2013 for one drink per day is effectively zero as well.\n \nThis study aims at scare mongering and has to admit that \n> Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. \n\nThis study still does not challenge \"moderate alcohol consumption may be preventive for some conditions such as ischaemic heart disease and diabetes\" but looks at the effects associated with each individual health outcome together with level of alcohol consumption. When those inferences are then combined into an aggregate according to the author's model we arrive at the picture above.\n\n> Specifically, comparing no drinks with one drink a day the risk of developing one of the 23 alcohol-related health problems was 0.5% higher\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning 914 in 100,000 15\u201395 year olds would develop a condition in one year if they did not drink, but 918 people in 100,000 who drank one alcoholic drink a day would develop an alcohol-related health problem in a year. \n \n> This increased to 7% in people who drank two drinks a day (for one year, 977 people in 100,000 who drank two alcoholic drinks a day would develop an alcohol-related health problem) and 37% in people who drank five drinks every day (for one year, 1252 people in 100,000 who drank five alcoholic drinks a day would develop an alcohol-related health problem).\n\n\nHow do experts judge this data? \n\n> [David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, said][3]:\n\n>\u201cAccording to data provided by the authors but not published in the paper, to suffer one extra alcohol-related health problem, around 1,600 people would need to drink two drinks totalling 20g (2.5 units) of alcohol a day for a year.  This is equivalent to around 32 standard 70cl bottles of gin over a year, so a total of 50,000 bottles of gin among these 1,600 people is associated with one extra health problem. **This indicates a very low level of harm in moderate drinkers, and suggests UK guidelines of an average of 16g a day (2 units) are very low-risk indeed.**\n\n>\u201cGiven the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no \u2018safe\u2019 level does not seem an argument for abstention. There is no safe level of driving, but government do not recommend that people avoid driving.  Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.\u201d\n\nThis same year another Lancet paper tried to tackle the problem:\n> [Angela M Wood et al.: \"Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599\u2008912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies\", Volume 391, Issue 10129, p1513-1523, April 14, 2018][4]     \nLow-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, we studied individual-participant data from 599\u2008912 current drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease.     \n**In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week.** For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These data support limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines.\n\nAgain, a call \"to lower guidelines\". Despite the result that for some outcomes the lowest risk was *not* \"zero drinks\" but that the relative risk increases, clearly, if you go below 100g of pure alcohol a week! \n\n> From the [supplementary material][5]: (click to enlarge)    \n> [![enter image description here][6]][7]\n> [![enter image description here][8]][9]\n> [![enter image description here][10]][11]\n> [![enter image description here][12]][13]\n\nDo these numbers really suggest that not drinking alcohol \u2013 either never or even worse to quit drining \u2013 is to be seen as a potential risk factor?  The huge difference between never-drinkers and ex-drinkers might spoil that party a bit. An equally plausible explanation for that is that dislike for alcohol might be a sign for already frail or future health problems. \n\n# Summary\n\nThe vast majority of findings show that moderate drinking (definitions of that may vary as much as does individual tolerance) is associated with a low risk and that there is an ultimately unexplained correlation between drinking a bit and slightly longer life expectancy. The [French Paradox][14] keeps on giving.\n\n\n  [1]: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31310-2\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGMyk.jpg\n  [3]: http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-systematic-analysis-of-the-health-impacts-of-alcohol/\n  [4]: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30134-X\n  [5]: https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30134-X/attachment/5b9e9977-5741-4caf-9ab1-ab873eef63fc/mmc1.pdf\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qc0U2s.png\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qc0U2.png\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/H4bV0s.png\n  [9]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/H4bV0.png\n  [10]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UUzrfs.png\n  [11]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UUzrf.png\n  [12]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZ6T8s.png\n  [13]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZ6T8.png\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_paradox", "18016": "They are mainly certain **sulfur** compounds that cause smelly gas [(Gut, BMJ Journals)][1]:\n\n> ...organic sulphides of bacterial origin, primarily methanethiol,\n> dimethyl disulphide, and dimethyl trisulphide, were the primary\n> malodorous compounds elaborated by faeces.\n\nThe cells of the large intestinal lining can break down hydrogen disulfide into dimethyl disulphide ([PubMed][2]), \"which...probably plays little part in flatus malodour\" [(Gut, BMJ Journals)][1].

I like the way this is phrased in a [journal of endocrinology][2]: \n> In response to stress, the level of various hormones changes.\n> Reactions to stress are associated with enhanced secretion of a number\n> of hormones including glucocorticoids, catecholamines, growth hormone\n> and prolactin, the effect of which is to increase mobilization of\n> energy sources and adapt the individual to its new circumstance.\n\n\nHere's a simplified diagram of adrenergic receptors and activity.

[Misoprostol][4] may be used in areas where oxytocin is not available.  Nipple stimulation and breastfeeding triggers the release of natural oxytocin in the body, therefore it is thought that encouraging the baby to suckle soon after birth may reduce the risk of PPH for the mother ([Abedi, et al. 2016][5]). The review by Abedi et al. (2016) looking into this did not find enough good research to say whether or not nipple stimulation did reduce PPH. More research is needed to answer this question.\n\nSo with this in mind, it seems that Oxytocin is a big clue.\n\nThe [physiological effects of Oxytocin][6] include uterine contraction. This is important for cervical dilation before birth, and oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of labour. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum.\n\nThe answer to my question is that **contraction of the uterine muscles during labour compresses the blood vessels and reduces flow, thereby increasing the likelihood of coagulation and preventing haemorrhage** ([Carroll, 2007][7]).\n>At parturition, only 0.5 L [just over 1 US Pint or 0.88 UK Pints] of maternal blood is lost, with the remaining excess volume lost gradually ([Carroll, 2007][7]).\n\nIf the placenta (or part of it) is still attached or detached but still in the womb, there is no way the uterus can contract enough to compress the blood vessels.\n\nA lack of uterine muscle contraction or [uterine atony][8] (a loss of tone in the uterine musculature), however, can also lead to an acute haemorrhage, as the uterine blood vessels are not sufficiently compressed.  This is where the management of PPH comes in.\n\nUterine massage is a simple first line treatment as it helps the uterus to contract to reduce bleeding ([Hofmeyr, et al. 2008][9]). Although the evidence around the effectiveness of uterine massage is inconclusive, it is common practice after the delivery of the placenta.\n\nThe WHO recommendations ([WHO, 2012][10]) include intravenous oxytocin. [Ergotamine][11] may also be used ([Weeks, 2015][3]).\n\n## References\n\nAbedi, P., Jahanfar, S., Namvar, F., & Lee, J. (2016).

There are generally 6 fertile days per cycle: 5 days before and 1 day after.\n\nA woman can ovulate on different days per cycle. In my own charts, I've seen ovulation occur anywhere from CD12 to CD18. Luckily, the female body begins to excrete cervical mucus around 6-9 days before ovulation in this pattern: dry, sticky, creamy, egg white.  Egg white mucus comes directly before ovulation (4+ days) and dries up after. You can further pinpoint ovulation using an OPK kit, cervical position monitoring, basal body temperature. \n\nSo you cannot know the probability of getting pregnant on a given day without knowing the day you ovulated. Once the egg has dissolved you cannot get pregnant from that moment until the next menstrual cycle.\n\nYou can read more about fertility awareness here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_awareness\n\nNFP can be very effective if done properly and there are no side effects!\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070221065200.htm\n\n**Please don't start using it unless you have taken classes with a practitioner first.**\n\nI really don't recommend that a woman should take oral contraceptives.

A low-FODMAP diet can reduce symptoms in fructose malabsorption and IBS.**\n\nMost study reviews, including the ones from 2016-2017 linked here, provide some evidence that a low-FODMAP diet decreases symptoms in individuals with fructose malabsorption ([1][3], [2][4]) and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ([3][5], [4][6], [5][7], [6][8]).\n\n**2. A low-FODMAP diet can reduce symptoms in Crohn's disease, but does not likely prevent the disease itself.**\n\nA low-FODMAP diet can be used as a temporary measure to reduce symptoms in Crohn's disease ([PMC][9]). [On the other hand][10], there is no convincing evidence that this diet decreases the risk of developing Crohn's disease.\n\n**3. Is a low-FODMAP diet potentially harmful?**\n\n[This][11] and [this][12] review from 2017 raise concern that a low-FODMAP diet may lead to nutrient deficiency and suboptimal intestinal flora and that...more research is needed.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**\n\n 1. Even if there is a lot of evidence that high-fiber diet, which is often also high-prebiotic, can be beneficial for health ([PubMed][13]), there seems to be no clear evidence that a low-FODMAP diet, which is also low-prebiotic, is harmful.\n 2. Every therapeutic approach, including a low-FODMAP diet, is justifiable until the health benefits outweigh the possible harms. For example, in fructose malabsorption, a commonly documented significant reduction in symptoms seems to outweigh theoretically possible but non-documented harms.\n\n  [1]: https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/137/3/830S/4664774\n  [2]: https://academic.oup.com/view-large/111067401\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28233394\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934501/\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5760846/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027396/\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5555627/\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918736/\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843040/\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15948806\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390324/\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372955/\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609775", "16484": "This is a good question, and although as you correctly state that HIV is an STI (see [STI vs STD vs Sexually Transmitted Virus?][1]) there is a difference with HIV which is one reason why it may be separated from others.\n\nIt can be thought that HIV is separated from STIs in factsheet titles etc. because HIV is a virus when others are not, but there are other STI viruses.  For example, there is:\n\n - [Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)][2], which is the name for a group of viruses that affect your skin and the moist membranes lining your body.\n - [Herpes][3], which is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2).\n\nIt can also be thought that HIV is separated from STIs in factsheet titles etc. because HIV can be fatal, but there are other STIs which can lead to death. For example:\n\n - [Syphilis][4] can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain, nerves, eyes, liver, heart, and blood vessels.  The effects on the heart can lead to death.\n - [Gonorrhea][5] can also spread to the blood and cause disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). DGI is usually characterized by arthritis, tenosynovitis, and/or dermatitis. This condition can be life threatening.\n - [HPV (Human Papillomavirus)][6] can cause cervical and other cancers including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (called\u00a0oropharyngeal cancer).\n\n<h2>Possible reasons for separating HIV from other STIs in factsheets</h2>\n\n1. The key thing with HIV is that **apart from [Hepatitis][7]**, which is also viral, all other STIs are generally only transmittable only through sexual contact. HIV can be transmitted through infected blood transfusions, use of infected needles, or through contact between **broken skin** of 2 or more people.\n\n**Note: Skin to skin contact with unbroken skin is safe**\n\n2. STIs are infections and STDs are the diseases as a result of the infection.  Some STDs don't share the same name as the STI which caused it.\n\n3. (This applies to your question) The linked factsheets etc. you provided are talking about the links between HIV and other STIs.\n\n<h2>How reason 3 applies here</h2>\nReading the [detailed version of the CDC factsheet on HIV and STDs][8]:\n>[P]eople who get syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes often also have HIV or are **more likely to get HIV** in the future. One reason is the behaviors that put someone at risk for one infection (not using condoms, multiple partners, anonymous partners) often put them at risk for other infections.  Also, because STD and HIV tend to be linked, when someone gets an STD it suggests they got it from someone who may be at risk for other STD and HIV.  Finally, a sore or inflammation from an STD may allow infection with HIV that would have been stopped by intact skin.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that studies that have lowered the risk of STD in communities have not necessarily lowered the risk of HIV.  Risk of HIV was lowered in one community trial ([Grosskurth, et al. 1995][9]), but not in 3 others ([Wawer, et al., 1999][10]; [Kamali, et al., 2003][11]; [Gregson, et al., 2007][12]).\n\nAlso, treating individuals for STDs has not necessarily lowered their risk of acquiring HIV ([Ghys, et al., 2001][13]; [Kaul, et al., 2004][14]).\n\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n[What is HPV?][2] \u2014 NHS<br>\n[Genital HPV Infection Fact Sheet][6] \u2014 CDC\n\n[Hepatatis Factsheets][7] - CDC\n\n[Genital Herpes Fact Sheet][3] - CDC\n\n<h2>References</h2>\nGhys, P.

When it gets dark people get tired. When it gets brighter we tend to wake up or stay awake. People can start having trouble getting to sleep or sleeping just because of lighting conditions, unrelated to other causes like medical conditions, taking drugs affecting sleep (like stimulants), or stress, or noise, or\u2026 Light is not the only [*zeitgeber*][1], but the latest scientific consensus says: \n\n> **23.2 Light therapy**   \nOur modern inventions have granted us control over our lighting environment (Fig. 23.2). We can choose to stay awake and surf the Internet by peering into our blue backlit screens all night if we want, or to retreat into dark, cool shelters of Abercrombie shops or watch the game at a local bar during the day. The temporal restructuring of light can lead to a state of circadian disruption, exposing us to new health risks and disease. Light is the most potent environmental cue able to predictably phase shift the timing of behavior (Khalsa et al., 2003). It is detected by the photopigment melanopsin localized in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Melanopsin is most sensitive to blue wavelengths of light and its activation leads to the release of glutamate onto the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract (Schmidt et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2012). The glutamate signaling causes immediate molecular and cellular changes in the SCN, including increases in firing rate and the induction of c\u2010fos and Per1 transcription that eventually lead to a shift in the timing of the molecular clock within the SCN and throughout the body (Chapters 1 and 2).    \nIn diurnal animals, exposure to even low intensities of blue light during the night can interfere with sleep by inhibiting sleep\u2010promoting neurons, acutely reducing melatonin levels, activating arousal\u2010promoting orexin neurons and stimulating the sympathetic axis (Duffy and Czeisler, 2009; Ruger and Scheer, 2009; Adidharma et al., 2012). In addition to poor sleep quality, light at night reduces daytime alertness the following day. Over a long period of time, these aberrant light cycles can increase the risk for serious diseases. Therefore, methods or behaviors that help reinforce the timing of natural, environmental light and maintain the normal variance of light intensities between night and day would reinstate a more robust and stable circadian system. Strengthening of the circadian network and enhancing circadian control of tissue function and physiology, will likely restore restorative sleep as well as daytime alertness helping to improve daily life and reducing the risk for disease.    \nIn practice, light therapy has been demonstrated to ameliorate circadian symptoms in some conditions, including advanced/delayed sleep phase syndrome, jet lag, shift work, seasonal affective disorder and depression (Burgess et al., 2002; Barion and Zee, 2007). The scheduled light exposure helped reestablish the daily sleep\u2013wake cycle and improve mood (Magnusson and Boivin, 2003; Wirz\u2010Justice et al., 2004). The positive outcome is encouraging the use of light therapy for other conditions that present with circadian symptoms, including aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In these groups, light therapy improved daytime alertness and sleep (Lieverse et al., 2011; Friedman et al., 2012; Royer et al., 2012; Rutten et al., 2012) and enhanced motor and cognitive abilities (Yamadera et al., 2000; Ancoli\u2010Israel et al., 2003; Riemersma\u2010van der Lek et al., 2008; Willis et al., 2012). Individuals suffering from major depression show improvements in mood when light therapy is included in the treatment regimen (Benedetti, 2012; Chapter 17).    \nHowever, other studies show no or small changes in objective and subjective measures of sleep (Ancoli\u2010Israel et al., 2002; Friedman et al., 2009). These discrepancies point out that a better understanding is needed of critical parameters such as light wavelength, intensity, and duration, as well as the timing of treatment, relative to the endogenous circadian rhythm. But it is worth re\u2010emphasizing that even young, healthy individuals can be influenced by improved light exposure (Viola et al., 2008). A study found that camping in the beautiful mountains of Colorado and exposure to natural lighting for several days was effective in advancing the phase of melatonin rhythms in young adults by two hours (Wright et al., 2013). Thus lighting conditions provide one of our most powerful tools to influence the circadian system.     \n([Christopher S. Colwell: \"Circadian Medicine\", Wiley-Blackwell: Hoboken, 2015][2], p 339\u2013340.)\n\n\n\nSo, less light overall is good for sleep. But then only \"overall\" if temporally related to wanting to sleep soon. Conversely, more light during the day also helps maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm. This rhythm of wake and sleep seems to be almost more important to keep relatively steady than getting enough natural daylight and sleeping in the dark.    \n([Charmane I. Eastman et al.: \"Dark Goggles and Bright Light Improve Circadian Rhythm Adaptation to Night-Shift Work\", Sleep, Volume 17, Issue 6, 1 September 1994, Pages 535\u2013543][3], https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/17.6.535)\n\n\n\nGuessing it does not count as science-related: electronic devices are so bad for your healthy sleep that even Apple offers now a redshifting feature in newer machines.

However, whether the timing of food intake influences the success of a weight-loss diet in humans is unknown.\n\n**OBJECTIVE**:\nTo evaluate the role of food timing in weight-loss effectiveness in a sample of 420 individuals who followed a 20-week weight-loss treatment.\n\n**METHODS**:\nParticipants (49.5% female subjects; age (mean \u00b1 s.d.): 42 \u00b1 11 years; BMI: 31.4 \u00b1 5.4 kg m(-2)) were grouped in early eaters and late eaters, according to the timing of the main meal (lunch in this Mediterranean population). 51% of the subjects were early eaters and 49% were late eaters (lunch time before and after 1500 hours, respectively), energy intake and expenditure, appetite hormones, CLOCK genotype, sleep duration and chronotype were studied.\n\n**RESULTS**:\nLate lunch eaters lost less weight and displayed a slower weight-loss rate during the 20 weeks of treatment than early eaters (P=0.002). Surprisingly, energy intake, dietary composition, estimated energy expenditure, appetite hormones and sleep duration was similar between both groups. Nevertheless, late eaters were more evening types, had less energetic breakfasts and skipped breakfast more frequently that early eaters (all; P<0.05).

Neither sleep duration, nor CLOCK SNPs or morning/evening chronotype was independently associated with weight loss (all; P>0.05).\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**\nEating late may influence the success of weight-loss therapy.

Our goal was to compare a weight loss diet with high caloric intake during breakfast to an isocaloric diet with high caloric intake at dinner.\n\n**Design and Methods**\nOverweight and obese women (BMI 32.4 \u00b1 1.8 kg/m2) with metabolic syndrome were randomized into two isocaloric (\u223c1400 kcal) weight loss groups, a breakfast (BF) (700 kcal breakfast, 500 kcal lunch, 200 kcal dinner) or a dinner (D) group (200 kcal breakfast, 500 kcal lunch, 700 kcal dinner) for 12 weeks.\n\n**Results**\nThe BF group showed greater weight loss and waist circumference reduction. Although fasting glucose, insulin, and ghrelin were reduced in both groups, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly to a greater extent in the BF group. Mean triglyceride levels decreased by 33.6% in the BF group, but increased by 14.6% in the D group. Oral glucose tolerance test led to a greater decrease of glucose and insulin in the BF group. In response to meal challenges, the overall daily glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and mean hunger scores were significantly lower, whereas mean satiety scores were significantly higher in the BF group.\n\n**Conclusions**\nHigh-calorie breakfast with reduced intake at dinner is beneficial and might be a useful alternative for the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome.\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.20460/abstract", "15360": "First of all, [anorgasmia][1] can be either a primary effect caused by depression itself, along with decreased libido.

Direct inquiry reveals that delayed orgasm/ejaculation occurs in >50% and anorgasmia in at least one third of patients given selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction can be successfully managed. A different antidepressant without significant sexual effects, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, can often be substituted. Other strategies involve drug holidays or adjunctive therapy with drugs such as sildenafil. Dopamine antagonist antipsychotic drugs are most commonly associated with decreased libido. [\u2026] Because sexual dysfunction can be related to many factors, care must be taken to establish the patient's baseline sexual functioning before the initiation of psychotropic drug therapy and to rule out other etiologies before drugs are implicated as causative.    \n(Caution: Clear Conflicts of Interest)\n\n\nUnfortunately, this field is still under researched and all the options above are only trying to solve a poorly understood problem.\n\n> [Mechanisms and treatments of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.][8]\n> SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction affects 30% to 50% or more of individuals who take these drugs for depression. Biochemical mechanisms suggested as causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors; decreased dopamine; blockade of cholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors; inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase; and elevation of prolactin levels. Five approaches to treatment include conservative approaches such as wait and see, decrease dosage, and drug holidays. More aggressive strategy for treating SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction are changing antidepressants and augmentation. \n\nOne possible mechanism in rats:\n> 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonism reverses and prevents fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction in rats.\n> Sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant treatment continues to be a major compliance issue for antidepressant therapies. 5-HT(1A) antagonists have been suggested as beneficial adjunctive treatment in respect of antidepressant efficacy; however, the effects of 5-HT(1A) antagonism on antidepressant-induced side-effects has not been fully examined. The present study was conducted to evaluate the ability of acute or chronic treatment with 5-HT(1A) antagonists to alter chronic fluoxetine-induced impairments in sexual function. Chronic 14-d treatment with fluoxetine resulted in a marked reduction in the number of non-contact penile erections in sexually experienced male rats, relative to vehicle-treated controls. Acute administration of the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY-101405 resulted in a complete reversal of chronic fluoxetine-induced deficits on non-contact penile erections at doses that did not significantly alter baselines. Chronic co-administration of the 5-HT(1A) antagonists WAY-100635 or WAY-101405 with fluoxetine prevented fluoxetine-induced deficits in non-contact penile erections in sexually experienced male rats. Moreover, withdrawal of WAY-100635 from co-treatment with chonic fluoxetine, resulted in a time-dependent reinstatement of chronic fluoxetine-induced deficits in non-contact penile erections. Additionally, chronic administration of SSA-426, a molecule with dual activity as both a SSRI and 5-HT(1A) antagonist, did not produce deficits in non-contact penile erections at doses demonstrated to have antidepressant-like activity in the olfactory bulbectomy model. Taken together, these data suggest that 5-HT(1A) antagonist treatment may have utility for the management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nBut notice the possibly contradictory explanation when relating this proposed mechanism with [Flibanserin][9]:\n> [Flibanserin, a potential antidepressant drug, lowers 5-HT and raises dopamine and noradrenaline in the rat prefrontal cortex dialysate: role of 5-HT1A receptors][10]\n\nInterestingly \"unconventional\" options are apparently not completely off in this regard:\n> The Mayo Clinic Proceedings [Antidepressant-Induced Female Sexual Dysfunction][11] (2016) considers the Peruvian herb/tuber Maca (Lepidium meyenii) an option because of this: [A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of maca root as treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women][12].\n\nIn conclusion this leaves not really much from the category \"definitively\" on the table right now: talk and try.\n\n> [Sexual Dysfunction Due to Psychotropic Medications.

Are you having symptoms of a tonsil infection? If so, what? Have you seen a doctor?\n\nFirst off, **Staph aureus is a normal skin and mouth bacteria**. In the study below, about 40% of patients had S. aureus in their throat on admission (not acquired in the hospital) (1). Since S. aureus is a normal part of our microbiome, **you do not need to take antibiotics to kill it unless you have symptoms of infection**, namely trouble swallowing, sore throat, fever, and pus coming from the tonsils (4). Even if you have tonsillitis, it's unlikely to be caused by staph-- the majority of cases are caused by a virus (4).\n\nWhat makes you concerned about S. aureus in particular? If you do have symptoms of infection in your tonsils, you should see a doctor. If they think the infection is likely due to staph, they will probably prescribe Bactrim, clindamycin, doxycycline, or cephalexin, though there are many good options (3). There is some evidence that citricidal may have antibacterial properties, but **citricidal has not yet been tested in human subjects so there is no way of knowing how well it works compared to antibiotics**(2).\n\nAgain, many people have staph aureus on their skin and in their mouths-- this is not the same as an infection.

Homeostasis of body fluid volume depends in large part on the ability of the kidneys to regulate the rate of water loss in urine.\n\n Normally functioning kidneys produce a large volume of dilute urine when fluid intake is high, and a small volume of concentrated urine when fluid intake is low or fluid loss is large. The Anti Diuretic Hormone (**ADH**)/sometimes called **arginine vasopressin**   controls whether dilute urine or concentrated urine is formed. In the absence of ADH, urine is very dilute. However, a high level of ADH stimulates reabsorption of more water into blood, producing a concentrated urine.\n\n\n> When water intake is low or water loss is high (such as during heavy\n> sweating), the kidneys must conserve water while still eliminating\n> wastes and excess ions.

What that means is that there are health **risks** you must take into account and decide whether it worths it. Smoking hookah can also be very beneficial in terms of the way you feel. For some people, those benefits overly exceed these on cigarettes, which is one of the reasons they quit smoking, which is a good thing, because cigarettes are more harmful than hookah, but they can also be less harmful than hookah. It depends on how much you smoke. The more you smoke the more the risk increases. People have tendency to abuse cigarettes more than hookah, partially because smoking cigarettes is easier, cheaper and more practical.\n\nSo, generally there are much more harmful chemicals in generic tobacco, but we will discuss the top 3 most hazardous of them. Videlicet:\n\n 1. [Nicotine][1]\n 2. [Tar][2]\n 3. [Carbon monoxide (and dioxide when oxygenation)][3]\n\nLet's start off with the nicotine.\n----------------------------------\n\nNot all hookah is prepared with a tobacco that contains nicotine. It could still be tobacco, but wiped out tobacco, soaked in water even boiled, until its full purification. I would still not give my bets on that though as it may still contain some levels of nicotine, which immediately turns it into an unhealthier product. You can also smoke shisha gels, shisha fruits, steam stones and Hookah Creams - all of these do not contain nicotine unless explicitly added.\nAlthough there is insufficient evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, there is an ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. Almost all hookah tobacco (like Al. Fakher, Gazi and whatever) contain approximately .05% nicotine. If it says .5%, that is probably a typo. Nakhla shisha is the only brand that boast .5% approx.\nthese percentages will stay the same regardless of whether you load a 20g bowl or a 100g bowl. That means if you buy 50grammes you will be smoking 0.025mg of nicotine around 5 times. Note that this is the general content of nicotine not the actual amount, being absorbed from the organism. The smoker inhales smoke, by which the nicotine absorbs. Hookah is something to be shared with a company, so very often it is being shared from 2 to even up to 10 people, distributing the total nicotine intake, but eventually exposing all to the secondhand smoke. How much of the substance you would get is determined by variety of different factors such as how long you smoke, how much smoke you inhale, how often you inhale. Some people think that because of the huge amount of smoke the hookah produces it is by any chances loading you with much higher levels of nicotine, which is not true, because 1. 50% of the smoke being produced is actually a vegetable glycerine and 2. Because the nicotine level will not magically increase, specially for your bigger clouds. Bigger clouds only means overtoasting the tobacco, which ultimately leads to a reducing time of use. At least pleasurable time. Almost all the times bigger clouds means shorter hookah session lifespan. One hookah session can vary but people generalize it to between 45 minutes and one hour. So there is still some nicotine you will absorb, which makes it unhealthy. Lots of people smoke cigarettes for 45 minutes too, smoking much cigarettes that contain much higher density of poison.\n[Nicotine leads to addiction][4]. Adding good flavors only make it more charming and more addictive.\n\nTar\n---\n\nThe tar is a known carcinogen.\nSometimes, this substance is even more dangerous, because unlike the nicotine, which absorbs in your body fast, the tar does not and it produces dense accumulation over time, that kills the pulmonary tissue. It may also cause cancer. ([Support Reference][5])\nThe process of purifying tobacco removes some of the tar, but not completely.\nCigarettes take advantage of some 3 centimeter filter of \"foam\" while the hookah gives you a few hundreds of water filtration, which \"wash\" the smoke itself.\nAnd it works a-okay. As the time goes and you smoke, you can notice that the water becomes more yellowish. Some people wrongly assume that's all tar, but it is proven that it contains so much more, including molasses and solid particles /heavy metals. The water does not only filter, but it also cools down the smoke and when the smoke is cooled down, it is lighter and when it is lighter it is easier for your lungs to aspirate it.\nSo a good practice is to put ice in the water phial. You can also try one of those [water enhancers][6]. Manufactures claim that it empowers the water with special molecular level filtration abilities. I haven't encounter scientific studies remotely related to this product yet, but from using it I can not tell.\n\nCarbon monoxide and dioxide\n--------------\nThis is what is being produced from the process of burning. It is being released by the charcoal. When smoking cigarettes you are exposed to a direct burning of a tobacco set on fire, which gives you a lot of carbon mono and some dioxide. When you smoke hookah, the shisha does not burn. It bakes. On a temperature of anything around 100C. But, I shall tell you that, the carbon monoxide released from angry lighter coal might exceed that from cigarettes and cigs, mainly because of the duration of your drag. Carbon monoxide might be the least of your problems. It causes dizziness, caused by the blood vessels (arterial) tightening, whereat the heart rate increases to compensate the blood delivery to your brain.\n___\nTo summerize:\nNicotine is in very low levels and density - there is a slight but existing risk of developing cancer and increase of cholesterol levels and even greater risk of addiction. Smoking inside somewhere may lead to a nicotine exposure equal to or greater than that if you were smoking, it depends on the place, its ventilation, air flow and how much people smoke.\n\nThe tar is in low levels and density, the more you smoke, the higher levels of it you accumulate. Smoking way too frequent leads to more tar being accumulated, which may damage everything between your mouth and lungs and cause cancer.\n\nCarbon dioxide isn't risky - it WILL violate human internal processes.\n\n**So it is unhealthy, obviously. Not so unhealthy to lead to death or cause irreversible consequences as such haven't been documented, to my knowledge.**\n___\nRead this:\nhttp://www.electroniccigaretteconsumerreviews.com/how-much-nicotine-is-in-one-cigarette/\n\nVery broad NCBI article on nicotine's effects:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4363846/\n\nIn case you need, you can find more support for all that, all over the internet.

The risk of infection from splashes onto non-intact skin or a mucous membrane is virtually non-existent if the exposed area is washed within 15 minutes. There is almost no risk of HIV transmission from nasal secretions, saliva, urine and vomit, unless they contain visible blood. The risk associated with sexual exposure to HIV varies enormously, depending on the type of sexual activity: almost non-existent for insertive fellatio; estimated at 1.5% for passive (receptive) anal intercourse with ejaculation inside the rectum. The risk of HIV transmission following injury from a sharp object contaminated with blood has been estimated at about 0.3%.\n\n> [**Risk of HIV infection attributable to oral sex among men who have sex with men and in the population of men who have sex with men.**][3]\n> We examined HIV infection and estimated the population-attributable risk percentage (PAR%) for HIV associated fellatio among men who have sex with other men (MSM).

PAR%, based on the number of fellatio partners, ranges from 0.10% for one partner to 0.31% for three partners. The risk of HIV attributable to fellatio is extremely low.\n\nBut these numbers might be quite misleading. These are statistical statements! They are *calculated* for the whole population and ***do not correspond to what a single individual will do or receive (that is \"get\").***\n\nInstead of finding a number to put the mind at ease a more comprehensive risk reduction strategy might be a much better choice:\n\n> [**Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission: quantifying the per-act risk for HIV on the basis of choice of partner, sex act, and condom use:**][4]<br>\n> **Background:**\nSexual acquisition of HIV is influenced by choice of partner, sex act, and condom use.

The evidence suggests that HIV transmission can take place through oro-genital sex from penis to mouth and vagina to mouth. Case reports describe apparent transmission from mouth to penis although this appears less likely. The risk of oro-genital transmission of HIV is substantially less than from vaginal and anal intercourse. Receptive oro-genital sex carries a small risk of human papillomavirus infection and possibly hepatitis C, while insertive oro-genital contact is an important risk factor for acquisition of HSV 1. Oro-anal transmission can occur with hepatitis A and B.

It is photostable and does not react with organic sunscreens under irradiation.\u00a0Conclusion:\u00a0Microfine zinc oxide is an effective and safe sunblock that provides broad-spectrum UV protection, including protection from long-wavelength UVA.\n\nIn 1999, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rule making that amended the tentative final monograph (proposed rule) for over-the counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products. \u2018[Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use](https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/102298b.txt)' states the following:\n\n> The agency discussed a study submitted to the Panel using zinc oxide alone and in combination with phenyl salicylate, another sunscreen ingredient (58 FR 28194 at 28213). The study was designed to measure the ability of zinc oxide (15 to 33.3 percent) to absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation over a broad range of wavelengths.\n\nIn the proposed rule, the agency also discussed the public health significance of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation and the characteristics and proposed labeling of OTC sunscreen drug products that claim to provide protection from UVA radiation. One comment measured the spectral absorbance of three formulations: (1) 4 percent zinc oxide, (2) 25 percent zinc oxide, and (3) 2 percent oxybenzone.\n\n>  Albino hairless mouse stratum corneum/epidermis samples were prepared by mechanical removal of the dermis using a dulled razor\nblade. The samples were cut into 1-inch circles and maintained in a hydrated state by floating the samples (dermal side down) on a water bath. The absorbance of each skin sample was measured and recorded. Ten microliters (<greek-m>L) of sunscreen were applied to the skin substrate, allowed to dry for 15 minutes, and the absorbance measured. The absorbance of each sunscreen treated sample was subtracted from the absorbance of the skin (without sunscreen) to yield the absorbance of the sunscreen. Five replicate measurements for each sunscreen formula were averaged and plotted with standard deviations at each 10 nm.\n\nThe spectral absorbance plots established that\n\n>...zinc oxide has a relatively flat and broad absorbance curve from 250 nm through 370 nm with a sharp drop in absorbance beyond 370 nm and extending into the visible spectrum. Comparison of the measurements of the 4 percent zinc oxide with 25 percent zinc oxide showed that the magnitude of absorbance is related to the amount of zinc oxide in the formulation.\n\nThese measurements adequately demonstrated that zinc oxide\n\n>...absorbs radiation between 290 and 380 nm and, thus, support effectiveness.\n\nAnother comment included the results of in vitro testing of a formulation containing 15 percent zinc oxide in a stable emulsion. The transmittance data supported the premise that \n\n>...zinc oxide can protect against UV radiation, including both UVB and UVA.\n\nOne comment included a spectral profile of attenuation for zinc oxide alone in a cosmetic formulation and from 1:1 and 3:1 combinations of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These spectral profiles of zinc oxide in various formulations demonstrated that\n\n> ...zinc oxide as a single ingredient can provide protection in both the UVB and UVA spectral regions.\n\nRecent scientific advances in understanding the photochemistry and photobiology of sunscreen drug products have raised many issues regarding sunscreen active ingredients, including zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Because zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have many similar physical characteristics and may be used in combination in OTC sunscreen drug products, the following discussion addresses both ingredients.\n\n> There has been renewed interest in using physical sunscreens, i.e., zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, in sunscreen formulations because these ingredients may confer protection for a broad range of the UV radiation spectrum. Some manufacturers have developed ultrafine forms of these ingredients in the range of 0.02 to 0.10 microns that are transparent on the skin, may offer both UVA and UVB protection, and are esthetically pleasing\u2026\n\nSunscreens have been generally classified as chemical (organic) or physical (inorganic) depending on whether they absorb specific UV radiation wavelengths or reflect and scatter UV radiation.\n\n> Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have been described as physical sunscreen ingredients that provide protection from UV radiation through reflection and scattering. However, new data and information indicate that they also absorb UV radiation as well as scatter visible light.\n\nVarious authors have shown that these ingredients exhibit a semiconductor optical absorption gap meaning they absorb most radiation at wavelengths shorter than the gap (approx. 380nm) and scatter radiation at wavelengths longer than the gap.\n\n> When zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are irradiated with light containing energy greater than the band gap (approximately 3 electron volts), an electron from the valence band can be excited to the conduction band, thus creating an electron-hole pair.\n\nThere are many formulation variables that may affect the photocatalytic capability of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.\n\n> Such variables include mineral components, particle size, surface area, crystalline structure, particle coatings, pH of the medium, differences in the refractive index of the medium, and other components in the formulation.\n\nAlthough the FDA continues to evaluate data and information for the purpose of proposing a monograph method for determining UVA radiation protection, it nonetheless finds\n\n> there is ample data demonstrating that zinc oxide provides protection against UVA radiation.\n\nAs it relates to the frequency one should apply sunscreen, a common recommendation by many public health agencies is to reapply sunscreen every *two to three hours*. Is this recommendation effective in minimizing ultraviolet exposure of the skin during time in the sun? \u2019[When should sunscreen be applied?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11712033)\u2019 studied how the time of sunscreen reapplication affects the solar ultraviolet exposure of the skin.\n\n> A mathematical model was derived that took into account typical amounts of sunscreen application and sunscreen substantivity to determine how these factors, when combined with the time of sunscreen reapplication, influence the photoprotection provided by sunscreen during exposure for several hours around mid day in strong sunshine.\n\nResults of the study were as follows:\n\n> Using a sunscreen that is readily removed from the skin achieves little in the way of sun protection, no matter when it is reapplied. For sunscreens that bind moderately or well to skin, typical of modern waterproof or water-resistant products, the lowest skin exposure results from early reapplication into the sun exposure period, and not at 2 to 3 hours, after initial application. Typically reapplication of sunscreen at 20 minutes results in 60% to 85% of the ultraviolet exposure that would be received if sunscreen were reapplied at 2 hours.\n\nThe concluding statement advises sunscreen users \n\n> \u2026to apply sunscreen liberally to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun, followed by reapplication of sunscreen to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes after sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary after vigorous activity that could remove sunscreen, such as swimming, toweling, or excessive sweating and rubbing.\n\nAnother abstract, \u2018[A noninvasive objective measure of sunscreen use and reapplication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15767357)\u2019, studied whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen. \n\n> Thirty volunteer office workers were randomly assigned to have one of a variety of sunscreens applied using recommended application techniques, and half were randomly assigned to have sunscreen reapplied after 3 hours. Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application. Absorption readings were analyzed using an UV-visible spectrophotometer\u2026The \u201cswabbing technique\u201d was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not.The swabbing technique was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not.\n\nThe study concluded with evidence indicating that the sunscreen swabbing technique is\n\n> an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication. This procedure will be a useful adjunct to other objective measures of sun protection and UV radiation exposure, resulting in a more accurate picture of the sun protection habits of individuals.\n\nMoreover, the Skin Cancer Foundation answers several relevant questions in an article titled \u2018[Sunscreens Explained](http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/sunscreens-explained)\u2019. \n\n> How much Sunscreen Should I Use and How Often Should I Put it On?\nTo ensure that you get the full SPF of a sunscreen, you need to apply 1 oz \u2013 about a shot glass full. Studies show that most people apply only half to a quarter of that amount, which means the actual SPF they have on their body is lower than advertised. During a long day at the beach, one person should use around one half to one quarter of an 8 oz. bottle. Sunscreens should be applied 30 minutes before sun exposure to allow the ingredients to fully bind to the skin. Reapplication of sunscreen is just as important as putting it on in the first place, so reapply the same amount every two hours. Sunscreens should also be reapplied immediately after swimming, toweling off, or sweating a great deal.\n\nFinally, to address your question: \u201cWhy do I need to reapply a zinc sun blocker if it has not been exposed to sun or sweat?\u201d; The International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s \u2018[IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention Volume 5](http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/prev/handbook5/index.php),\u2019 explains in Chapter 6: [Other beneficial effects of sunscreens](http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/prev/handbook5/Handbook5_Sunscreens-6.pdf), that there are other potential beneficial effects of sunscreens that are not related to the prevention of skin cancer include prevention of painful sunburns, photodamage and photoageing UVR-induced provocation of certain cutaneous diseases, and photoimmune suppression.\n\n> Use of sunscreens can prevent skin diseases from progressing acutely after exposure to the sun; these diseases include cutaneous lupus erythematosus\u2026and reactivation of herpes labialis\u2026 The other potential benefits of sunscreens are related to the type and duration of exposure to UVR. Prevention of photodamage and photoageing, which are related to cumulative exposure to UVR, in countries where solar irradiance is intense throughout the year requires daily, longterm sun protection\u2026 Prevention of acute flares of cutaneous diseases, which may be related to episodic exposure to UVR, requires anticipatory use of sun protection.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, diseases of various etiologies can be aggravated by sunlight in people who on other occasions may react normally.\n \n> These diseases include lupus erythematosus, lichen planus and herpes simplex. The disease most frequently recognized as requiring careful photoprotection from both UVB and UVA is lupus erythematosus in the discoid, systemic and subacute forms\u2026The available evidence suggests that regular use of sunscreens reduces morbidity from both cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematous.\n \nTherefore, if you are unsure about whether it is necessary to wear sunscreen indoors, you may want to consider your medical history and potential predisposition toward developing a disease that may increase the need for more intensive \"sun-blocking\" protective measures. However, it is always advisable to consult with your primary care physician and/or dermatologist with any personal health-related questions or concerns.", "594": "Washing and peeling conventional fruits and vegetables only helps to reduce the levels of pesticides that may be on the surface as reflected by USDA test data<sup>[1999][1]</sup>.

If, for example, you hurt yourself playing a sport and want to take a painkiller for some short-term relief, ibuprofen *probably* won't do you much harm in the short term.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are in chronic pain (or inflammation, as another answer notes) the situation is a little different. If you are taking an [NSAID](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anti-inflammatories-non-steroidal/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - ibuprofen is one of several in this class of drug - on a regular basis it's worthwhile watching out for some side effects. One mentioned in the article you linked are [stomach ulcers](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Peptic-ulcer/Pages/Introduction.aspx) as NSAIDs can have an effect on the protective lining of the stomach.

This resulted in two of these drugs, Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib or Vioxx, being withdrawn from the market.\n\nThe Vioxx controversy was a pretty big deal, and resulted in compensatory payouts and fines. The [VIGOR study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200011233432103#t=article) demonstrated a 4-fold increase in heart attack risk on rofecoxib (Vioxx) versus naproxen.

This was incorrect, and another trial ([APPROVe](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa050493) was stopped early because selective COX-2 inhibitors demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events. There was a [raft of litigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib#Litigation) relating to the sale of Vioxx, with payouts and fines in the billions of dollars.\n\nIf you are interested, the Vioxx controversy created lots of discussion ongoing to this day- from editorials, to book sections, entire books themselves and arguments relating to tort reform. It is clearly beyond the scope of this question! \n\nThat said, not all NSAIDs are Vioxx; and as noted above, it is possible to take them (even ibuprofen) relatively safely.\n\n## What are the alternatives to ibuprofen?\n\nAs another answer comments, it depends on what you are taking ibuprofen for. As mentioned above, you may be fine continuing to take ibuprofen, depending on circumstances.\n\nAlternatives include:\n\n - naproxen (another NSAID, but with [lesser risk / may be protective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019238/))\n - paracetamol / acetaminophen (ie Tylenol, as you say)\n - NSAID cream / gel, eg for joint pain\n - tramadol may help for some kinds of pain, but there are issues with addiction and constipation\n - alternatives, such as exercise, acupuncture, meditation etc can all potentially reduce pain\n\n----\n\n##Further Reading\n\n\n - [NHS page on NSAIDs](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anti-inflammatories-non-steroidal/Pages/Introduction.aspx)\n - [VIGOR](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200011233432103#t=article), for reference\n - [APPROVe](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa050493), also for reference\n - [Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019238/)\n - [Heart-safer NSAID alternatives](http://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-safer-nsaid-alternatives)\n", "11610": "You don't specify which test was used to screen for TB, in this answer I will assume that [Mantoux test][1] was used.\n\n---\n \nYou probably were vaccinated using [Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin][2] vaccine.\nUnfortunately this has been proven not to give an efficacious immunity against TB infection.\n\nIn this scenario there are two chances:\n\n 1.

Theoretically, it is possible that a surgeon removes the gallbladder with stones, but some stone remains hidden in the ducts. Ultrasound should detect this. At next ultrasound, you can ask a doctor if any gallstones are mentioned in your medical documentation.\n\nIf they find a gallstone in a common bile duct, they can remove it by a type of upper endoscopy called [**ERCP**][1].\n\nAnother quite common cause of the gallbladder-like pain after gallbladder removal is **biliary dyskinesia,** or more specifically **[sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD)][2],** which can be due to a spasm of the muscular sphincter at the end of the common bile duct (where it opens into the duodenum). The exact cause is not known, but may be partly psychosomatic or related to certain foods (a bit like in IBS). The pain in SOD appears in the upper right abdominal quadrant (usually just at the bottom of the rib cage), builds up to a steady level and then remains constant and lasts at least 30 minutes.\n\nIt is also possible that the original problem may not be associated with the bile ducts but with the pancreas. Pancreas can produce [**pancreatic stones**][3], which can block the pancreatic duct and cause pancreatitis. These stones can be also removed by ERCP.\n\n  [1]: http://www.ddc.musc.edu/public/procedures/ERCP.html\n  [2]: http://www.iffgd.org/upper-gi-disorders/sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction.html\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10464344", "10774": "There are a few terms to define here, and I'll go through them one by one:\n\n**T2**\n\nThis has to do with the type of scan. MRI's are pretty complicated technologically, but the basic idea is that body tissues are full of water, and water molecules respond to magnets. If you turn on a really powerful magnet near body tissues, the water molecules in the tissues will align with the magnetic field. Turn off the magnet and pulse a radio signal, and you'll shake the molecules back into a random alignment and they'll shoot back a radio signal as they move. This is called *magnetic resonance*.\n\nIf you can detect all the little radio signals coming back from all the molecules and figure out where they all came from, you can map out where all the water molecules are, which tells you where the tissues are. Do it precisely enough, and you can make a high-quality image of whatever tissue you're scanning. This is *magnetic resonance imaging*, or MRI.\n\nThe problem is, like with a camera, you only get an image of one side. If you want everything in 3D, you need to repeat this again and again from a bunch of different angles. That's what you're hearing when the MRI machine goes bang, bang, bang, bang, bang... \u2014 the machine is getting the image again and again from every possible angle. It's also repeating images on each location for more information.\n\nThere are a few variables you can tinker with to tune the image to what you're looking for, most notably repetition time (TR), how long you wait between each pulse, and time to echo (TE), how long between the radio pulse being sent and the echo being captured. If you set the machine to wait a very short time between pulses (short TR), and a very short time between sending each radio pulse and capturing its result (short TE), you're going to get what's called a T1-weighted image. Much longer TR and TE produce a different image, called a T2-weighted image. Even longer, and you get a FLAIR image.\n\nThese are just names for the different types of scans you can get by playing with TR and TE, but the rationale for what makes an image T1- or T2- weighted is based on properties of the water molecules themselves, literally quantum physics. You're welcome to look them up though if you like, and get a really good understanding of exactly what makes the image look that way.\n\n**Hyperintense Focus**\n\nIntensity on an MRI refers to the brightness of a given spot. But because doctors are doctors, instead of calling it a spot, they refer to a given location on the MRI as a \"focus.\" This term tends to be reserved for when something special is going on there.\n\nTo go a bit deeper into intensity, a *hyperintensity* is a spot that's brighter than you'd expect it to be, and a *hypointensity* is a spot that's darker than you'd expect it to be. In a T2-weighted MRI specifically, watery tissues shine brightest, meaning that a hyperintensity \u2014 or hyperintense focus \u2014 in a T2 MRI is a particularly watery area, often something unusual. But exactly what it means depends on where the hyperintensity is.\n\n**White Matter**\n\nYour brain is divided into two basic types of material, white matter and gray matter.\n\nBroadly speaking, the gray matter forms the outermost surface of the brain, the cerebral cortex, which is in charge of most of the actual thinking that takes place in your brain, like getting input from your senses, sending output to your muscles, and connecting the two with, well, your consciousness and most human mental abilities.\n\nWhite matter on the other hand is like all of the wires that connect the gray matter together, and sits below the surface of the brain.\n\nStructurally, you can think of the white matter as the \"body\" of the brain and the gray matter as the \"skin,\" even though the gray matter does just about all of the actual thinking.\n\n**Subcortical**\n\nThere are really three important sections of the brain when it comes to hyperintensities: the periventricular white matter, the deep white matter, and the subcortical white matter. The subcortical white matter is just a little bit deeper than the gray matter of the cerebral cortex. The deep white matter is even deeper than that, going towards the center of the brain, the ventricles. The periventricular (\"near the ventricles\") white matter is right along the ventricles at the innermost parts of the brain.\n\n**Right Middle Frontal Gyrus**\n\nThe cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, is divided into four lobes from back to front and bottom to top: the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe. If you only look at the gyri, or outer folds of the brain, you end up with the colored areas below:\n\n[![Gyri of the Cerebrum][1]][1]\n\nThe frontal lobe is then divided into a number of sections, the main three of which are the superior, middle and inferior gyri, labeled above as *gyrus frontalis superior*, *gyrus frontalis medius* and *gyrus frontalis inferior*. The middle section, the middle frontal gyrus, is what we're looking for. Because the brain is split into left and right halves, we end up with two middle frontal gyri, the left one and the right one, shown below.\n[![Red Middle Frontal Gyri][2]][2]\nThis is the brain of a guy facing you from the front, looking slightly to your right. The part of his brain you're seeing would be just under the forehead. The red sections are the left and right middle frontal gyri. Remember that these parts are labeled from the perspective of the guy whose brain it is, and not from the perspective of the observer. So the red spot to the left is his right middle frontal gyrus.\n\n### All Together\n\nFinally, what is a T2 hyperintense focus in the subcortical white matter of the right middle frontal gyrus?\n\nThe T2 tells you that the image was made using a T2-weighted MRI scan. The hyperintense focus is a bright spot, likely caused by higher than expected water content. Remember that bright doesn't mean \"compared to the rest of the scan,\" it means \"compared to how that area is supposed to look.\" The subcortical white matter is just the white matter directly below the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain. The right middle frontal gyrus is the left red section in the image above.\n\nSo all in all, it's a brighter than expected spot in the layer of white matter just below the outer surface of the brain, in the red section to the left above.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n - http://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/Web%20Neurorad/MRI%20Basics.htm\n - https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/neuroradiology/image-acquisition/magnetic-resonance-imaging/mr-terminology\n - http://casemed.case.edu/clerkships/neurology/NeurLrngObjectives/NeurLrngObj_Stroke01new.htm\n - http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2015/01/education-whats-mri.html\n - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4307690/\n\n**Images:**\n\n - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gehirn,_lateral_-_Hauptgyri_beschriftet.svg\n - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cerebrum_-_middle_frontal_gyrus_-_anteriior_view2.png\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pFedC.png\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qA5m.png", "10649": "There's no reason to expect a full recovery within a short period of time.

The [most common kind]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14728222.2014.922956) of male hair loss is Androgenic alopecia (AGA), and the most common mechanism for this is buildup of 5\u03b1-DHT in the hair follicle (ibid).  5\u03b1-DHT comes from testosterone (T) after being modified by an enzyme.  It then shortens the amount of time the hair has to grow:\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n[(1)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14728222.2014.922956#)\n\nThe false argument that masturbation would lead to hair loss then goes something like this:\n\n  1.\tElevated levels of 5\u03b1-DHT lead to hair thinning  \n  2.\t5\u03b1-DHT is derived from T \n  3.\tMasturbation elevates T \n  4.\tElevated T leads to elevated 5\u03b1-DHT\n  5.\tTherefore, masturbation leads to hair thinning.\n\nPutting it in more formal logic may be giving to much credit to those proposing the theory, but it let\u2019s address where the critical problems are.  The first thing to attack is 3.  This was probably not the aim of any study, but is a tangential finding in a few studies. [One]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552705) looked at the T levels of men and self-reported masturbation frequency and found no correlation (they were actually studying sex drive).  I couldn\u2019t find an example of study which took males from a base line \u201cfast\u201d of masturbation, recorded T levels, and then had them masterbate, and I don\u2019t really know who would fund such a clinical study (but that would directly answer the question).\n\nSo what does effect T levels?  Other than non-natural sources like steroids, things like [overall fitness]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22314983), [vitamin D levels]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26610790), and [mental state]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26488864).  Also, you don't want to reduce your T levels if you can avoid it, as it is likely providing several positive benefits.\n\nThe loss the third statement already puts a hole in the logic, but statements 1 and 4 also pose problems.  \n\nIt is not the global (systemic) production of 5\u03b1-DHT that is the problem.  In fact any significant amount of 5\u03b1-DHT in the sera is probably a sign of other problems.  Rather, it\u2019s the [local production]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16931898) of 5\u03b1-DHT within the hair follicle that leads to AGA.  Further that over production of 5\u03b1-DHT is more closely linked to higher levels of the 5\u03b1-reductase enzyme that synthesiszes 5\u03b1-DHT from T (ibid).  In  turn the enzyme levels are likely set [primarily by genetics]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022534708002905), with environmental factors like diet and stress adjusting from your baseline (speculation, looking for a source).\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/fH6w6.jpg", "9163": "Laparoscopic coagulation of endometrial spots itself is one of the clinically approved treatment for endometriosis.

Concerning your question about the potential of remyelination: There isn't much information available on ADEM and remyelination, but at it shares some common features in terms of pathogenesis with multiple sclerosis (MS), let's take some evidence concerning remyelination in MS:\n\nWe know that the treatment of MS aims at two things (1,2):\n\n - Prevent further damages by modulating the inflammatory processes. This is normally achieved with immunomodulatory therapies.\n - Repair the demyelination which resulted from the pathological inflammatory process by stimulation remyelination, ie the regeneration of new myelin sheats.\n\nWhile the first has showed some interesting results thanks to growing number of immunomodulatory therapies on the market (among which glucocorticoids, which are also used in ADEM treatment), the second has still to be proven. \n\nAlthough some immunomodulatory therapies might indirectly stimulate remyelination, current therapies directly targeting regeneration of myelin sheats have yet to be proven. Furthermore, the presence of axon degeneration despite immunomodulatory therapies, suggest that axon integrity and protection may occur through mechanisms independent of inflammation (3,4).\n\nHuang et al provide a good summary of **current approach for remyelination** (5):\n\n> The principal source of new remyelinating cells is an abundant and\n> widely distributed population of cells in the adult CNS traditionally\n> called oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In the adult CNS, these\n> cells are both self-renewing and multipotent, having been observed to\n> give rise to certain neurons, astrocytes (albeit rarely), and Schwann\n> cells, as well as oligodendrocytes\u00a0in vivo, and so can reasonably be\n> regarded as a type of adult neural stem cell. The response to\n> demyelination causes OPCs to become activated, a morphological change\n> accompanied by upregulation of genes not normally expressed in the\n> resting state. Activated OPCs proliferate, migrate and rapidly fill up\n> the demyelinated lesions at a density that far exceeds that in normal\n> tissue. To complete the remyelination process, the cells exit the cell\n> cycle and differentiate into myelin sheath-forming oligodendrocytes,\n> which is a complex process involving axon engagement, ensheathment and\n> formation of compacted myelin.\n\nThe article by Huang et al also provides a good review (it is open access) on the current pharmacological targets for remyelination as well as the barriers of remyelination (among which age, probably explaining while cases of ADEM in the adults show a worse outcome that cases in children).\n\nHope this brings some clarification!\n\nSources:\n\n 1.

The introduction of bacteria able to compete with *C. difficile* rebalances the fecal microbiota - under normal circumstances, CD is outcompeted by other bacteria (not always enough to vanish, it can be found [in about 1 in 30 healthy people][2], but enough to not be problematic), and it can only thrive after the use of antibiotics. A FMT reintroduces its competitors \n 2. The introduction of the 'new' bacteria leads to an immune response that helps eradicating *C. difficile*\n\nThe first mechanism is what I found mentioned in a few other sources as well, for example on [OpenBiome][3]:\n\n>  Though the mechanism has yet to be determined, it is believed that FMT works by repopulating the patient\u2019s microbiome with diverse microorganisms that competitively exclude *C. difficile*\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the acid composition in the feces is significantly altered and inhibits growth of CD, see [Changes in Colonic Bile Acid Composition following Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Are Sufficient to Control *Clostridium difficile* Germination and Growth][4].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491681/\n  [2]: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/clostridium-difficile/pages/introduction.aspx\n  [3]: http://www.openbiome.org/about-fmt/\n  [4]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147210", "5048": "I've written on this subject a few times, but the most [relevant question][1] ended up being closed, and the other is on [Bio.SE][2], so I will mostly focus on tailoring the information there to the specifics of this question.\n\nIf you look at ether of my previous answers, you will note the first thing we need to establish is what is causing the common cold.  From the body of evidence coming from the [US][3] and [China][4] I believe the answer to that is [HRV][5] followed by [RSV][6].\n\nYour immune system is actually [directly attacked][7] by two of the proteins RSV makes when it infects cells (NS1 and NS2).  This knowledge is actually linked to a pretty cool [vaccine idea][8] for RSV.  Thus I think it quite appropriate to think that active RSV infections weaken your immune system.\n\nLooking at the very good epidemiology data coming from China ([here's another example][9] in addition to the first), it seems that the rate of co-infection, that is something else besides these two viruses infecting the patient, is quite high, particularity with RSV.  This would imply that other pathogens take advantaged of a \"weakened\" immune system in an RSV infection.\n\nIt's less clear with HRV, but that might just be because of how amazingly common HRV infections are.  It [seems][10] as though HRV induces a good [immune response][11], in [healthy patients][12], but it was still commonly found with other pathogens present (though not in rates as high as RSV).  There is not a clear mechanism for HRV if it is in fact weakening the immune system (which actually might be better described as a \"distracted\" immune system in this case).\n\nAs for what you can do?  Not a whole lot once symptoms show up.  Contrary to whatever ads you may see, even some [poor un-blinded trials][13], taking vitamin C is [not going to help][14] after you [already have the cold][15].  Even the [prophylactic benefit][16] seems to only be in certain cases, and I want to strongly discourage megadosing vitamin C, which in most cases does nothing helpful (and can [cause problems][17] of it's own).\n\nStaying hydrated is always a good option, as is washing your hands and coughing/sneezing into your elbow to prevent infecting others.  Other than that, you can hope for any of the vaccine candidates currently be researched to actually work, or that one of the small molecule inhibitors (anti-viral drugs) to actually be safe.\n\n\n  [1]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4456/in-a-viral-infection-which-symptoms-are-caused-by-the-virus-itself-and-which-s/4528#4528\n  [2]: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold/21802#21802\n  [3]: http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jrm/2014/469393/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321179\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557722\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249281\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750056/\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806456\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767874\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122508\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10543583\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010554\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440782\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636648\n  [17]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7008359", "4141": "Short\n====\n\n[You **should** brush](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/healthy-teeth-14/brushing-teeth-mistakes), 20-30 minutes after eating on the night (just before you sleep) *and*, 10-20 minutes before eating your breakfast. Midday brushing, is not essential for most albeit, it's highly dependent on your dietary habits. The same rule applies: 20-30 minutes after eating or 10-20 minutes before eating. The time-rule is influenced/is-in-place to compensate for the time it takes for the normalization of the oral PH after food consumption (\"after a meal\"), and the latter being to ensure that the introduction of food stuffs and liquids will not diminish the concentration of the essential [fluoride](https://www.dentalhealth.org/tell-me-about/topic/sundry/fluoride), contained within toothpaste, on the tooth surface (\"before a meal\").\n\n---\n  \nLong\n====\n\nNot brushing after you eat, before you sleep on the nighttime, can be likened to having oral excrement...\n\nWhenever you eat/have a meal, our [oral microbiota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_microbiology) ingest and metabolize the food particle left over, essentially feasting on whatever we consume. Like every other living organism, these oral bacteria excrete as they reap. However, *this* secondary excrement is highly *acidic* and can have some unwanted effects on your tooth enamel: gradually dissolving it and henceforth leading to the occurrence of tooth [decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay) (cavities).\n\nWhen you decide to \"hit the hay\" without brushing, considering you have eaten since, plaque may start to harden and hence, *calcify* on the surface of your teeth. It's important to know that, once calcification of the [plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque) on the tooth surface has began to occur, we (yourself), cannot remove it with a toothbrush nor with any amount of [floss](https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3576/2344); it can only be removed by a [dental hygienist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist)  via a routine cleaning using specialist equipment.\n\nIt doesn't just stop there! As plaque begins to build up, your immune system treats it as if it's an infection. Your immune system doing what it does best, triggers the release of in situ [Prostaglandins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin), to trigger an immune response via lipid signalling. As opposed to a \"positive\" immune response, the healthy tissue that adhere the gums to the teeth to the gum surface are attacked and harmed (degenerated) causing it form periodontal pockets and cause [gum recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis). Periodontal pockets, can predispose plaque formation and hence, foreign bacteria colonisation below the gum line - along the tooth *root*. This healthy tissue is known as the, attached [Gingivae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva) and it doesn't just permit a snug fit, it helps to keep to teeth in place!  \n\n[![Stages of gum disease][1]][1]\n\nDon't get me wrong, inflammation is good thing! Albeit, a long-term presence of inflammation can predispose you to a worrying amount of tissue damage. For example, take the common flu: short-term inflammation is essential for cell signalling, to help route immune factors such as phagocytes, to the site of the harmful bacteria and hence, to ingest and destroy the foreign bacteria -- known as [Phagocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis); helping to make you \"healthier\" again. However, long-term inflammation causes unwanted bodily \"wear and tear\", that has been found to [correlate with some very serious diseases and impairments](https://www.perio.org/consumer/other-diseases) such as, Heart disease, Dementia and secondary Hearing loss.\n\n**Yes** - non of this will happen over the course of one night. But, if it becomes habitual (not brushing before you sleep -- or flossing), the probability of it happening will steeply increase!\n\nConsidering that, this small precaution will help save you a heap of money and pain in the future, is it *not* worth it? Evidence shows that it may even extend your life! \n\n----\n\nConclusion\n=======\n\nThe amount of [saliva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva) produced is [greatest](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531122) when we are awake (during the day), and diminishes greatly during natural sleep and this in fact reduces the ability of our saliva to natural control oral PH and partially digest food particles in our oral cavity. The protein profile (and hence, enzymatic activity) of our [salivary rate is not the same during rest as that, when we are eating or when sleeping](http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1745-4603.2011.00290.x?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_referrer=onlinelibrary.wiley.com&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED) - less salivary flow. Salivary secretion during wakefulness is, in part, associated with oromotor activity involving the masseter muscles. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity and swallowing are non-disruptive events that occur during normal sleep. It's hypothesised that the natural lubrication that saliva permits is most-necessary during sleep to protect tissue integrity and health of oroesophageal structures. \n\nMouth breathers, during sleep need to pay particular attention to oral hygiene as the prominence of \"dry mouth\" is much more evident - this is impirical due to reasons stated above.\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MmfMl.png", "3908": "I don't know if anyone can give a definite answer as to why *these* folks so badly wanted you to donate platelets over whole blood, but there are many possible reasons.\n\n 1. **Platelets give you more bang for your buck.** According to [the American Red Cross](http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/types-donations), one session of platelet apheresis can collect enough platelets for one or two transfusions. On the other hand, it can take anywhere from four to six donations of whole blood to get the same amount of platelets.\n 2. **Platelets are always needed, at high rates.** The first point is important, because those who use platelets often use them in bulk (some organ transplant patients need up to 30 units worth<sup>1</sup> - see [a page from University Health System](http://www.universityhealthsystem.com/plateletpheresis/)).\n 3. **Platelets have a short shelf life.** [Blood Centers of America](http://bca.coop/products-services/blood-products/platelets/) states that even with some processing, platelets need to be transfused within about five days after the donation, meaning that waiting can cause the loss of an entire donation. There is a constant need for refills (for lack of a better word). Even this narrow window has been modified in the past, shrinking or growing (see [Sireis et al. (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21517896)).\n 4. **Platelets are used for cancer patients.** The [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/about/get-involved/donating-blood/faqs-donating-blood-platelets/platelet-donations) says that patients who are suffering from leukemia or have just had a bone marrow transplant may have low platelet levels. The transfusions can be essential - life-saving.\n 5. **People might not like donation platelets.**<sup>[Citation needed!]</sup> This one is a complete guess on my part, but platelet donation can take a long time, as you said. People are averse to donating blood for many reasons; as you stated, the long donation session for platelets only makes this worse. You've shown that you were willing in the past to go through with this, so the blood donation center probably thinks that you're more likely to do it again.\n\n---\n\n<sup>1</sup> One donation can give about 6-8 -\"units\". See the [Johns Hopkins Pathology page on platelets](http://apps.pathology.jhu.edu/blogs/pathology/being-an-apheresis-volunteer-platelet-donor) for more information.", "927": "About 1/4 - it varies with the reflectivity of the surface, and angle of the sun.

Please, bear with me for a while, to see the *longer answer*:\n\nThe problem with concentration when you haven't eaten arises primarily because of the lack of nutrients, i.e. glucose.\n\n> Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. [...] Fatty acids do not serve as fuel for the brain, because they are bound to albumin in plasma and so do not traverse the blood-brain barrier. In starvation, ketone bodies generated by the liver partly replace glucose as fuel for the brain. (1)\n\nSo basically, you can't focus because **your brain lacks fuel**. It's somewhat similar to a car: yes, you can add water to the radiator (and need to), and yes you can add sparks to make your engine start, but without fuel it just won't run.\n\n**Caffeine will not only fail to solve your problem, but can actually be harmful on an empty stomach.** It can hurt both your stomach and can make you feel even less focused after a short while.\n\n> Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. (2).\n>\n> Caffeine may increase an individual's sensitivity to hypoglycemia through the combined effects of reducing substrate delivery to the brain via constriction of the cerebral arteries, whilst simultaneously increasing brain glucose metabolism and augmenting catecholamine production. [...] Under laboratory conditions, acute ingestion of caffeine markedly enhances the symptomatic and sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycemia in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes. (3)\n\nTo sum it up - caffeine will make you more alert for a short while, but it will eat up little fuel that you had left, and leave you almost completely without it. For the half hour, 40 minutes perhaps, you will feel better, but then the problems will start - even stronger sense of hunger, worse problems with focusing on your work and possibly light-headedness and hand trembling might occur.\n\n> Heartburn is the most frequently reported symptom after coffee drinking. It is demonstrated that coffee promotes gastro-oesophageal reflux. Coffee stimulates gastrin release and gastric acid secretion [...] Coffee induces cholecystokinin release and gallbladder contraction[...] (4)\n\nCaffeine will stimulate the release of gastric acid and bile, which are meant to digest food. But, since there will be no food to digest it will begin to \"digest\" your stomach instead (well, not literally, but it can cause you pain and problems, especially if you make a regular practice of it).\n\nWater might leave you feeling fuller for a while, but it won't solve the underlying problem (lack of brain fuel), and large quantities of water, drank in a relatively short time span, on an empty stomach, might leave some feeling a bit sick (the smaller the stomach volume, the worse it gets). It's not dangerous, but can be uncomfortable.\n\nThe solutions:\n----\n\n 1. Do you ever forget your keys? Your mobile phone? Well **make a habit of not forgetting your snacks.** It is simply a matter of priorities, and health is a priority. (And do make sure that the snacks are as healthy as possible).\n 2. Have a contingency snack plan: keep a bag of raisins (e.g.) in your purse. If you change purses, keep a bag of raisins in every purse, or next to something that you won't forget (e.g. your keys).\n 3. Keep a pack of raisins (or something similar) at work (in your desk perhaps).\n\nFor 2 and 3 - just remember to occasionally check those places and expire dates - no one likes to find a 10-month old bag of raisins in their purse/desk/key drawer.\n\n________________________________________\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

From what I found, the primary culprit of drug interactions in grapefruit juice lies in [naringenin][2]; however, other [compounds][3] play a role as well.

Breakthrough bleeding is not uncommon, especially early on, and the pill is still effective at preventing pregnancy. You should, however, report breakthrough bleeding; your doctor may want to change your pill. \n\nBreakthrough Bleeding is one of the most common reasons for women to stop taking their pill. However, it is still an effective contraceptive when taken regularly. An adjustment of one of the components of your pill can stop breakthrough bleeding.\n\n>[B]reakthrough bleeding... is vaginal bleeding that occurs during your active pills. This is a common side effect during the first 3 months of birth control pills use and up to 50% of users may experience this.

Some may notice some mild menstrual cramping with the spotting but this should resolve for most by the third pack of pills as well. Contraceptive effectiveness is present even with spotting, as long as no pills have been missed. If you are experiencing light bleeding on your active pills that lasts longer than 5 days, or heavier bleeding lasting more than 3 days, contact your provider.\n\n***Evidence on the association between antibiotic use and combination oral contraceptive (COC) failure remains controversial, with recent studies reporting no evidence to support decreased effectiveness of birth control with the use of antibiotics except rifampin and rifabutin.***\n\nHowever, some doctors will ask an oral contraceptive user to use additional protection while using an antibiotic. \n\nThe reasoning that antibiotics might interfere with the effectiveness of COCs revolves around the antibiotic decreasing steroid hormone\u2019s plasma concentrations by hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with enterohepatic circulation of COC metabolites, interference with absorption from the GI tract, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, alterations in plasma protein binding, induction of an opposite physiologic effect, or increased urinary or fecal excretion of the contraceptive.\n\nThe strongest evidence is for rifabutin and rifampin: a significant decrease in the hormonal levels was noted in women taking rifampin even after *a single dose.*  Dirithromycin slightly decreased plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, with questionable clinical importance. A recent study in the Netherlands *did* find a relationship between the use of antibiotics and breakthrough pregnancy in a population-based *prescription* database; also, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives.  \n\nBecause of earlier studies, anecdotal reports, and the above (it's not possible to identify whose levels will drop with antibiotic use), a cautious approach is advised. Physicians and pharmacists (80-90% of both) still lean towards believing that broad-spectrum antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of COCs, and continue to advise the use of back-up contraception. \n\nThe tide is shifting, however, as new studies come out. Here are a few excerpts of recent studies:\n\n>Available scientific and pharmacokinetic data do not support the hypothesis that antibiotics (with the exception of rifampin) lower the contraceptive efficacy of oral contraceptives. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2002;46:917-23.) \n\nSince dermatologists treat acne with antibiotics, and a significant percentage of these patients are young women of child-bearing age, they certainly have a vested interest in knowing if this is true.\n\n>Rifampicin and griseofulvin induce hepatic enzymes and do appear to have a genuine interaction with the COCP, leading to reduced efficacy. The situation with the broad-spectrum antibiotics is less clear. There are relatively few prospective studies of the pharmacokinetics of concurrent COCP and antibiotic use and few, if any, demonstrate a convincing basis for any reduced contraceptive efficacy.\n>\n>We did not find an association between concomitant antibiotic use and the risk of breakthrough pregnancy among COC users. However, due to limited power and potential carryover effects, findings from this study cannot rule out an elevated risk of COC failure among antibiotic users. (2011)\n\nSo, the answer is (except with your noted exceptions) the penicillin-class antibiotics *probably do not interfere with effectiveness of COCs.* However, one unwanted pregnancy is one pregnancy too many, and the use of a back-up method is not a huge deal (just ~14 days).\n\nUntil more and larger studies demonstrate a lack of interaction between most antibiotics and COCs, this will likely be the advice people continue to receive. When you look at the risk to benefit ratio of back-up, it's probably the wisest course for people prescribed a short course of antibiotics. It is more significantly problematic for people prescribed continuous antibiotic use for acne, Crohn's and other conditions/illnesses.\n\n<sub>[Birth Control Pills (BCPs)](http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/safer_sex_and_contraceptives/birth_control_pills.php)</sub> \n<sub>[Birth Control Pills \n(Oral Contraceptives)](https://www.rochester.edu/uhs/healthtopics/SexualHealth/contraception/files/BirthControlPills.pdf)</sub>   \n<sub>[Oral contraceptive efficacy and antibiotic interaction: A myth debunked](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962202000373)</sub>  \n<sub>[Interaction between broad-spectrum antibiotics and the combined oral contraceptive pill: A literature review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782499000098)</sub>  \n<sub>[Antibiotics and oral contraceptive failure \u2014 a case-crossover study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782410005172)</sub>  \n<sub>[Are antibiotics related to oral combination contraceptive failures in the Netherlands?

I think it's answerable as an overview, but please know this is only the tip of the iceberg.*\n\n**Summary**: Yes, we have deficits of certain blood products in certain locations at certain times that affect patient care. However, a small percentage of blood product does expire unused (because it wasn't the *right* product [see background] in the *right* place at the *right* time).\n\n**A little background**  \n\nDonated blood is not usually transfused into a patient as whole blood. Instead, it's broken down into several components which are transfused in different clinical scenarios. The issues of storage and supply are different for each component. The components are:\n\n- Plasma, and derivatives\n- Red Blood Cells (RBCs)\n- Platelets\n- Granulocytes (rarely transfused)\n\nThese different components require different storage conditions, so they are separated as soon as possible after donation.\n\n**OP's first question**:\n> First, do we ever have a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?\n\nYes. Well, actually your question is impossible to answer. :-) We could never know whether someone could-have-been-saved with a transfusion nor whether someone who received a transfusion would-have-died. Those are hypothetical constructs that are interesting to think about but are not compatible with research. \n\nHowever, we *can* ask whether there is evidence that blood supply on a clinical level is limited, for instance: \n\n- doctors are requesting products that aren't available for patients;  \n- doctors are requesting fewer products than they think would be ideal for a particular patient because of a blood bank shortage;    \n- elective surgeries are being postponed; or \n- blood banks are substituting products that may have a slightly increased risk of complications due to less-than-ideal immune compatibility.\n\nAll of these are more nuanced than they seem, but to some degree all do occur. \n\nQuoting from a [paper in the journal Transfusion entitled *How do I manage a blood shortage in a transfusion service?*][ljm]:\n\n> Although there are more than 16 million blood donations per year provided to more than 4 million recipients, blood shortages have recurred for decades [...] twice every year. Anyone with any experience at blood centers or transfusion services is quite accustomed to these expected shortages.\n\nHe further notes that this problem is likely to worsen because the requirement for transfusions (all types) is increasing at a rate of 5-7% per year while donations are not matching that increase.\n  \nThe first thing that happens when there is a blood bank shortage usually involves the Transfusion Medicine specialist in the blood bank having a conversation with every doctor who orders the blood product that is limited. Together they determine whether a smaller amount of product or a deferment in transfusion might be clinically appropriate/acceptable. \n\nThe distinction between those last two words &mdash; `appropriate|accetable` &mdash; is the key to whether clinical care is actually being compromised. In many cases, [clinicians indeed are requesting product beyond what is recommended in published guidelines][ot], because they feel that the patient's condition warrants it due to some special circumstance. It seems likely that at least a small percentage of the time, the clinician was right, but this can never be proven.\n\nIt is also the case that [elective surgeries are sometimes postponed for this reason][nb] (see chart 8-1, p 43), although it's rare. \n\n**Another question**\n> Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?... is it used for medical research?\n\n\nAlthough localized shortages of particular products do occur and are disruptive, it is true that a small percentage of the products expire unused. In the U.S., this was estimated at 14% of supply in 1989 and had fallen to 5.2% in 2011, per [a report from the US Dept Health and Human Services][nb], the most recent data available I've found. These are complicated and nuanced data that this format does not allow complete explanation of (and I myself am not completely familiar with), but please read [the linked HHS report][nb] if interested.\n\nAs for what happens to the excess - it's probably discarded, although I can't prove that. Regarding your question about research: In addition to being sub-optimal because it's old, the blood was originally collected from human donors. Such research would be subjected to IRB requirements for protection of human subjects. This would likely require researchers to obtain permission from donors (/subjects) at the time of donation to use the product for research. This may happen in localized settings, but I know of no large-scale project.\n\n-----\n\n[ms]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17319817\n[ot]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26019707\n[ljm]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17465938\n[nb]: http://www.hhs.gov/ash/bloodsafety/2011-nbcus.pdf\n\n<sub>\n* I limit this discussion to the U.S. While I realize the weaknesses &mdash; inadequacy, really &mdash; of that approach, this is the healthcare system where I was able to locate data, the O.P. is apparently asking about the U.S. situation (Red Cross), and I am most familiar with the clinical situation here.

Also, addiction has been studied in relation of people's habit of eating food that is prepared with a combination of ingredients, as donuts or french fries, not separated ingredients. There are many studies that **address the issue of excessive consumption of food as a real addiction**, similar to that caused by drugs such as cocaine, heroin, alcohol and tobacco (Blumenthal & Gold, 2010; Moreno & Tandon, 2011).\n\nDr. Ifland identifies the **refined products (sweeteners, carbohydrates, fat, salt and caffeine) as the substances that have the greatest potential to cause addiction**. Our body is programmed to recognize sugars and fatty substances as fundamental for life and health: they're energy reserves and address us toward the consumption of fruit, rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. With the refining of foods we have an exaggerated concentration of sugars and fats, and this disrupts our evolutionary adaptation (Ifland et al., 2009).\n\nIn the **explanation of the mechanisms** of addiction, there are at least three factors that contribute to the excessive consumption of foods. In the case of sugar and refined flour, part of the explanation goes through the concept of glycemic index: foods with **high glycemic index** - and load - cause a rise in blood sugar, which leads to an increase of insulinemia and subsequent hypoglycemia that is felt as hunger (Lennerz et al., 2013; Ludwig, 2002). Other explanations rely on the production of **endogenous opioids** caused by sugars that then would act as stimulants (Drewnowski, Krahn, Demitrack, Nairn, & Gosnell, 1992, 1995), and the lower efficiency of **dopamine receptors**, which would lead to increased consumption of food to achieve the same satisfaction (Wang et al., 2001; Wang, Volkow, Thanos, & Fowler, 2004). Lastly, a final interpretation refers to the fact that a high consumption of carbohydrates leads to increased levels of **serotonin**, which is perceived as a pleasant sensation (Wurtman, 1988).\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBlumenthal, D.

There are too many factors on an individual basis to make it a blanket kind of projection. The closest that I found for any kind of writeup that addresses it is [this published article][1].\n\nThe pertinent part of that is this section here:\n>**How Much Alcohol Must Be Ingested (and over what period) for a Person to Develop Alcohol Dependence and to Be at Risk for Alcohol Withdrawal?**\n>\n>There is no absolute relationship between pattern of alcohol use and the risks of physiologic dependence and withdrawal, which most likely reflects the significant number of variables, in addition to duration and quantity of alcohol use, that can contribute to dependence and withdrawal risk for a given individual. Some of these additional variables include age, medical comorbidities (such as hepatic dysfunction), concomitant medication use, and seizure threshold.\n>\n>It has been easier to quantify the risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal, based on degree of benzodiazepine use (even though benzodiazepines act at the same receptor as does alcohol and are cross-reactive with it). For example, daily use of 20 mg of diazepam for 3 weeks or longer is believed to be sufficient to induce physiologic dependence.[3][2] However, the shorter half-life of alcohol (1\u20132 hours) has made similar predictions elusive in the case of alcohol abuse. In general, any suspicion of daily alcohol use over several weeks or more, regardless of quantity, should raise concern over possible alcohol withdrawal.\n\nSo, while you can make some possible predictions, you may just have to look at the drinking history pattern and project from that, and make preparations for withdrawal symptoms to occur in cases of extended consumption, even if it the first time the patient has consumed in that manner.\n\nAs far as the preparations, there is [this article][3] which addresses the clinical features, assessment and management of AWS (Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome).\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1540391/\n  [2]: http://Gonzales%20JJ,%20Stern%20TA,%20and%20Emmerich%20AD.%20et%20al.%20Recognition%20and%20management%20of%20benzodiazepine%20dependence.%20Am%20Fam%20Phys.%201992%2045:2269%E2%80%932276\n  [3]: http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-1/05-12.pdf", "824": "In March, journal \"Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience\" published three reviews in Article in Press -section related directly to this topic [(Ling et al. 2015, ][1][Daneshvar et al. 2015, ][2][Gardner and Yaffe 2015)][3].\n\nThere is major epidemiological evidence stating the association between moderate or traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) (Gardner and Yaffe 2015). \n\nThere are several studies investigating association between one time MTBI and dementia. Schofield and co-coworkers stated \"Incident Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with head injury which occurred within the preceding 30 years\" [(Schofield et al. 1997)][4]. There have been many recent studies in this topic. Lee et al. stated \"TBI is an independent significant risk factor of developing dementia even in the mild type\" [(Lee al al. 2013)][5]. Nordstr\u00f6n et al. stated \"In the present study, we found strong associations between YOD (young onset dementia) of non-AD forms and TBIs of different severity\" [(Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2014)][6].\n\nAll these studies are cited in recent literature review in which authors state \"Taken together, these studies suggest that there is likely a small, but significant, risk of dementia following a single MTBI that is not solely due to reverse-causation or confounding. It is likely, however, that younger adults may be more resilient or may take longer to develop dementia than older adults who sustain a MTBI\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  \n\nCTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) is a neurogenerative disease linked to exposure to repetitive MTBI [(Wikipedia)][7].

Prevalance of CTE among former professional American football players have ranged from 50% to 97%. In one study stage of CTE was associated to years of football exposure, \"lending weight to a true causal association\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015). \n\nAs so there is mounting evidence of the association between (repetitive) MTBI and neurogenerative diseases but there are many epidemiological (\"secular trends\",\"reverse-causation\") and study protocol related (clinical criteria for CTE, quantification of MTBI) issues which warrant further research in this topic. Authors of the recent review state \"Recently, large epidemiological studies have reported that MTBI and repetitive MTBI are also significant risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, but these associations are not yet aswell established and require further replication\" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  \n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770439\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25758552\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748121\n  [4]: http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/62/2/119.long\n  [5]: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062422\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812697\n  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy", "372": "Nitrates and nitrites cause a lot of consumer confusion. They're naturally occurring molecules in vegetables.\n\nSeveral foods are sources of [nitrates][1] (salts) which are a normal part of the diet as they occur naturally and they're produced by a number of species of [nitrifying bacteria][2]. Only excessive levels can cause any health problems ([methemoglobinemia][3]).\n\n[Sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite][4] (salts) are added to cured and processed meats as reducing agent (opposite of oxidation agent) to delay spoilage and pathogenic bacteria growth and to preserve its color.\n\nHistorically nitrite and nitrate were considered harmful food additives where they were considered carcinogenic, however recent research has change our ideas about health effects of both nitrite and nitrate and newly studies show no association between its intake and stomach or ovarian cancer. Further more, they're now considered as essential nutrients for cardiovascular health by promoting [nitric oxide][5] (NO) production.<sup>[2010][6], [2012][7]</sup>\n\nHowever under certain conditions, nitrite can form nitrosamines, molecules that cause cancer in lab animals. This happens when nitrites are exposed to high heat during cooking or strongly acidic conditions (stomach acids), they could form carcinogenic [nitrosamines][8]<sup>[2006][9], [2007][10], [wiki][11]</sup>. As the result the U.S. Department of Agriculture established the safety limits on the amount of nitrites used in meat products in order to decrease cancer risk in the population. This could indicate that nitrosamines may be carcinogenic in humans.\n\nAlthough available evidence supports a positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer (GC) and oesophageal cancer (OC), they're not conclusive<sup>[2006][12], [wiki][13]</sup>.\n\nThe recent research suggests that nitrite preservatives have \"been found to be safe\"<sup>[2012][14]</sup>.

Each of the meds in the cocktails that stave off AIDS limit the ability of the virus - the HIV virus - to reproduce.\n\nIt can be argued that AZT is effective against more viruses than HIV alone. Reverse Transcriptase (necessary for viral replication) is an enzyme necessary to the replication of many viruses. However, the AIDS denialists claim:\n\n>...because the drugs are anti-viral and *anti-bacterial in nature*, they give a false impression of being effective for treating HIV infection. What appears a miraculous recovery in many patients is, in fact, the drugs\u2019 effects upon the opportunistic infectious agents the person may harbor at the time, other than HIV. (from your source)\n\nAZT is not an antibactial. Antibiotics (as well as things not to be taken internally, e.g. bleach) are antibacterials. Antibiotics treat *Pneumocystis jiroveci* (formerly known as *Pneumocystis carinii*) and other microbial infections; they are useless against the common cold and other viruses. \n\nPneumocystis first came to attention as a cause of interstitial pneumonia in severely malnourished and premature infants during World War II in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, it is more common in immunosuppressed patients: \n\n>Clinically significant Pneumocystis pneumonia is virtually never observed in immunocompetent adults. Indeed, documentation of Pneumocystis jirovecii\nin a patient without known underlying disease should prompt a careful search for occult immune suppression... trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole [the *antibiotic* Bactrim] remains  the  most  effective regimen for treating severe Pneumocystis pneumonia... Patients with previous Pneumocystis pneumonia should receive lifelong secondary prophylaxis, unless reconstitution of the immune system occurs. ...Ledergerber and colleagues analyzed episodes of recurrent Pneumocystis pneumonia in 325 HIV-infected patients after they had peripheral blood CD4 cell count greater than 200 cells/ml and found no cases of recurrent Pneumocystis during a follow-up period totaling 374 person-years. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/ml.\n\nAn antibiotic can treat P. pneumonia in HIV-infected patients, but cannot restore immunocompetency; only anti-retrovirals can.\n\n>The standard treatment [of HIV] consists of a combination of at least three drugs (often called \u201chighly active antiretroviral therapy\u201d or HAART) that suppress HIV replication. Three drugs are used in order to reduce the likelihood of the virus developing resistance. \n\nOn the near-miraculous effect of combined antiretroviral in the treatment of HIV, your paper observes:\n\n>Because these drugs also attack non-infected cells, they can destroy the immune systems\u2019 healthy T-cells, and even cause a collapse identical to AIDS. \n\nBut they offer no evidence of such a claim. No drug is without potential side effects. Some antibiotics can cause aplastic anemia, a condition certain to result in an immunocompromised status. However combined antiretrovirals save lives, they do not *cause* AIDS.\n\nThe paper is full of similar holes.\n\nDeniers gain footholds by building straw men and knocking them down, not by advancing credible science.\n\nUntreated, HIV causes AIDS. Anti-retrovirals prevent it's development. \n\n\n\n<sub>[An Official American Thoracic Society Statement: Treatment of Fungal Infections in Adult Pulmonary and Critical Care Patients (2010)](http://www.thoracic.org/statements/resources/tb-opi/treatment-of-fungal-infections-in-adult-pulmonary-critical-care-and-sleep-medicine.pdf)</sub>  \n<sub>[World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/topics/antiretroviral_therapy/en/)</sub>  \n<sub>[White swans, black ravens, and lame ducks: necessary and sufficient causes in epidemiology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2081238)</sub>  \n<sub>[Inventing the AIDS virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_AIDS_Virus)</sub>  \n", "478": "In the blister shown, the likelihood of rupture is decreased because of the thickness of the epidermis on the palm of the hand, so you can leave it alone until the underlying area re-epithelializes. You'll know this is happening because of the decreased pain and the slow reabsorption of the fluid. Eventually you will just peal it off what's left of the blister, finding clean new skin underneath.\n\nBut this is a great starting point for an answer about the treatment of blisters in general: is it better to leave them alone, drain the fluid, or de-roof them (take the top of the blister off)?\n\nThere is *a lot* of disagreement about what constitutes the optimal treatment of blisters. Some background might be in order.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nBlisters form when the upper layers of the epidermis separate from the lower layers, usually at the level of the stratum spinosum. At that level, the cells (because of proximity to the dermis, which contains the capillaries) have moisture in and between them. When the separation occurs, *sterile* fluid from the stratum spinosum oozes unopposed into the space between the layers, and a blister forms.\n\nThe fluid, similar to plasma, contains molecules which may promote the rapid division which takes place in the stratum basale.  This then differentiates into the upper layers of the epidermis and healing by new skin formation.\n\n>Hydrostatic pressure causes the area of the separation to fill with a fluid that is similar in composition to plasma but has a lower protein level. About 6 hours after formation of the blister, cells in the blister base begin to take amino acids and nucleosides; at 24 hours, there is high mitotic activity in the basal cells; at 48 and 120 hours, new stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, respectively, can be seen.\n\nThe *sterile* fluid is a very rich and inviting growth medium for bacteria. For this reason, some people think it should be removed. The denuded skin underneath has lost some of it's protection against infection. For this reason, some think the blister should be left intact. Between these two extremes are those who favor drainage of the fluid leaving the cover intact.\n\nTo my thinking (and training), this is the worst option. Poking a hole in the blister, no matter how cleanly it's done, will leave a point of entry for bacteria (it doesn't take much). The bacteria will flourish in the moisture (which will still seep into the space) under the roof of the blister, protected from being washed away. This may (and often does) lead to an infection of the wound.\n\nIt's much better to prevent infection than to treat it. \n\nThe reasoning of either of the other camps is more supportable. I favor leaving the blister intact as long as possible, giving the underlying wound time to form new stratified protective epidermalis.\n\nTreatment by people in this camp consists of carefully cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the blister and the surrounding skin, and covering it loosely with protective padding, usually gauze, then wrapping the entire thing with gauze wrap. The patient is instructed to check the blister daily; if it \"pops\" or becomes cloudy, the roof must be removed (most people prefer to have this done by a doctor or nurse), the area cleaned to remove any bacteria which might have entered, and a sterile dressing (over a light application of an antibacterial cream) reapplied, and changes daily until healed.\n\nThe opposite camp reasons that the blister will break anyway, so get it over with and get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream) daily. Also, if the blister is tense, it may be impeding healing of the base by decreasing blood flow. The problem with this approach is that it hurts more than leaving it alone, and the risk of infection is still greater than if the blister is intact.\n\nMany studies have been done to try to determine the best approach. Common sense plays a role. If the blister is very delicate (as in a large, tense and fragile blister of a burn), or if it looks unstable, I'll remove the roof of the blister. If I think it can be preserved for even one or two days, I'll leave it on. Every day it's left on without infection is a day of healing and decreased pain as new skin is made.\n\nFrom one paper:\n\n>There seems to be a paucity of good clinical evidence related to this subject, despite several review articles. The sole paper found involved a small sample, but showed infection rates to be higher if blisters are aspirated or deroofed, and that pain scores were higher in the group that underwent deroofing.\n\nFrom a pain point of view:\n\n>aspiration appears to result in less pain than deroofing. (See above: also more infection.)\n\nThe common sense comes in with type, size, and location of blister, reliability of care by the patient or their family, location or level of activity likely to cause rupture, or in the case of hikers' blisters (and others away from medical care), what the best model is to prevent infection while still using the involved area if necessary.\n\nAlso changing the scene are the new available protective dressings of deroofed blisters that allow moist healing, non-occlusive protection and visibility of the underlying skin. \n\n<sub>[Management of burns blisters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564175/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Friction blisters.

Now, while the exact figure of 3500 calories is somewhat open to debate, that is the rationale. 500 calories a day = 1 pound of loss per week.\n\nThe problem with crash dieting is twofold. One, the majority of the weight lost is water weight, and will rapidly return once the person hydrates themselves. The second problem is that in an effort to lose large amounts of weight in a short time is that people will essentially starve themselves, and possibly do so while adding in exercise.\n\nIn the very short term, this may not pose any problems for a healthy person, but if the dieter is compromised in any way health wise, or the practice is continued for a longer period then nutrient deficiencies can start arising, which can introduce a long litany of health problems.\n\nAnother problem is that people that lose large amounts of weight in a short time tend to binge eat once the diet period is over, and regain most if not all the weight. Many even end up weighing more than they did before they did the extreme dieting.\n\nThere have been studies comparing many of the popular diets such as Atkins, South Beach, China Study, Paleo, and on and on. They have all shown that weight loss is a simple factor of calorie reduction. Eat less calories than you expend, and you will lose weight. Period. (And \"starvation mode\" is a myth.) When you first start dieting, you may lose more than the 1-2 pounds a week, which is normal.

Results showed that humeral antibody production in rats is seriously affected that may lead toward cancer. In 1977 FDA proposed a ban on saccharin use due to cancer reports in laboratory rats (Arnold, 1984; Tisdel et al., 1974; Schoenig et al., 1985; Taylor et al., 1980).\n\nThe  results  of  the study by [Arnold (1983)][6] resulted  in  the  prohibition  of  saccharin  in  Canada  and  a  proposed  ban  in  the United  States.  This  proposed  U.S.  ban  was withdrawn  in  1991,  but  foods  containing  saccharin  were required  to  carry  a  warning  label.  This  warning  label  was  placed  on all  products  containing  saccharin  to  indicate  \u201csaccharin  is a  potential  cancer  causing  agent.\u201d\n\nSupporting evidence for carcinogenicity given by [Saad, et al. (2014)][2] includes studies from the 80s and 90s:\n>Exposure to pure saccharin supported its role in pathogenesis of the liver damage (Negro et al., 1994). Several studies have been done which shows association between bladder cancer and saccharine (Fukushima et al., 1986; Shibata et al., 1989; Cohen et al., 1991; Ito et al., 1983; Fukushima et al., 1983; Fukushima et al., 1986). All of the ingested saccharin after circulation in blood excreted through urine from body (Sweatman et al., 1981).\n\nHowever, [Whitehouse, et al. (2008)][7] points out that (emphasis mine)\n>[A  2007  article  by  Gallus  et  al.][8]  discussed  artificial sweeteners  and  associated  cancer  risks.  The  authors  reviewed  several  case-control  studies  and  **found  a  lack  of association  between  saccharine,  aspartame,  and  other sweeteners  and  several  common  neoplasms.

Second, the guidelines for further diagnosing the serious cases of pneumonia generally recommend establishing the actual pathogen, [e.g.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473649/): \n\n> Optimal treatment of lung infections relies on rapid and accurate detection of the offending pathogen. Delay in diagnosis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nSee also https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/questions/22913/use-of-antibiotics-with-chest-infections for a bit more detailed discussion on this.\n\nAdditionally, early in the epidemic, [evidence from China (Mar 4)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0846537120913033) was that [their] virus tests were actually rather insensitive, i.e. they could only detect high viral loads:\n\n> In the initial screening, computed tomography (CT) examination is needed for the auxiliary diagnosis. The diagnosis is\nthen confirmed by the positive results of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of the respiratory tract or blood specimens\nusing reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this diagnosis method is\nhighly limited: (1) **When the viral load is low, the detection rate\nis low, leading to false-negative results.** (2) Only a positive\ndiagnosis can be made, but the severity of COVID-19 and its\nprogression cannot be judged (in contrast, CT imaging can\nreveal disease progression). (3) The supply of the reagents\ncannot keep up with the demand, and the quality of new products of major companies awaits to be studied and improved. (4)\nIt takes 1 day or longer to obtain the results after sampling. For\nthese reasons, **Chinese researchers strongly recommend CT\nimaging as the main basis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in\nthe current situation**.\n\nSo in such circumstances (low-sensitivity tests) the virus tests probably aren't even very useful for the mild cases, so \"saving\" [such insensitive] tests for these mild case is basically completely pointless.\n\n(See also related q here on that latter issue: https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/questions/23126/why-were-so-many-covid-19-negative-tests-among-close-contacts-of-the-early-chine )", "23139": "I think you're asking if multiple courses will exceed the maximally recommended cumulative dose of 120-150 mg/kg though that is not steadfast as your reference also says\n\n>  One recent study of 116 patients found that a cumulative dose of 220 mg/kg or more may result in lower relapse rates, but confirmation will require study in larger populations.278\n\nHowever, the half life of isotretinoin is \n\n> The half life is 22 hours and the bioavailability is 25%. \n\nSo, once a course of treatment has finished, and a delay is instituted to allow the drug to clear from the system, another course of treatment can be instituted.\n\n> Further courses of therapy are usually successful when required. There are no reports of cumulative toxicity from using repeat courses and tachyphylaxis has not been noted.\n\nIn other words, the cumulative dose refers to a single treatment course and not a combination of all treatment courses.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835909/\n", "23091": "The only viral diseases for which I found this method [mentioned (in the popular pres)](https://time.com/3586271/ebola-treatment-dialysis-blood/) has been Ebola (in 2014), and that's an experimental treatment.\n\n>  The device, called the Hemopurifier, was attached to the dialysis machine that was already filtering the patient\u2019s blood. The specially designed filter is made of a protein that acts as glue for proteins found on the Ebola virus\u2019s surface. Over a period of 6.5 hours, the filter extracted the virus from the blood that flows through. While most dialysis filters can pull out molecules that are less than 4 nanometers in diameter, the virus filter boasts a mesh that\u2019s able to filter out larger viral particles that are less than 250 nanometers. That means only the virus is pulled out, and the immune cells remain in the blood, ready to fight off any remaining viral invaders.\n>\n> \u201cWe had no [idea] about how much [virus] would be extracted, because this was the first patient, but I was very surprised because the drop in viral load was deeper than I expected,\u201d says Geiger. Before the filtration began, the patient\u2019s virus count was about 400,000 per mL blood. After the session it had dropped to 1,000 copies/mL. [...]\n>\n> Freed from that viral burden, the patient soon began to improve rapidly. His own immune system began fighting off the remaining virus, and he no longer needs dialysis or a ventilator. The patient is walking and waiting to be released from the hospital.\n>\n> Geiger stresses that it\u2019s not clear yet whether the Hemopurifier alone was responsible for the patient\u2019s recovery, since he was given other experimental therapies, but the amount of virus removed from his body and his rapid recovery after the filtration suggests that it at least played a role in helping him survive his infection.\n>\n> While **puling viruses out of infected individuals has never been tried before**, Geiger believes it will be an important strategy for treating not just Ebola but other vial infections as well, including HIV, hepatitis and even influenza. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting concept. The big advantage is that the plasma is filtered, and only the virus is removed and the other plasma components like immune cells go back to the patient. That\u2019s important because with viral infections, the patient is in a reduced immune situation.\u201d\n\nThe inventors mention influenza as a possible target too, but frankly I suspect that was way optimistic.\n\nA [search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hemopurifier) in pubmed for \"Hemopurifier\" only finds 3 articles (and the 2001 hit is a name coincidence for an unrelated device), none of which are even about Ebola (never mind influenza), but there is (a 2009) one [about hepatitis C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19169020). You can look through the [(37) Google Scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1451534700552079321&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en) of that 2009 paper for subsequent research.\n\n(The 2nd real hit in pubmed for \"Hemopurifier\" was a more cited 2012 article on exosome removal in cancer patients. Unfortunately, most of the citations for the 2009 hep-C paper seem to also be about exosome removal...) There is one [2014 review](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/375257) about Ebola though that mentions the Hemopurifier as follows:\n\n> Recent discoveries have led to the development of specific extracorporeal sorbent techniques to reduce viral particle concentrations in blood. The application of a specific device called \u2018Hemopurifier' has been advocated to reduce viral load in several acute viral infections [8]. Blood is circulated through a hollow fiber plasma filter that has a specific sorbent matrix stuffed in the compartment external to hollow fibers. Due to the fluid mechanics inside the device, plasma is produced from whole blood in the proximal part of the fibers and it is forced to flow through the sorbent bed. In the distal part of the device, plasma reenters the hollow fibers by a backfiltration mechanism. No plasma loss occurs since plasma never leaves the device (the plasma ports are left capped). According to the company's specifications (Aethlon Medical Inc., San Diego Calif., USA), the sorbent is highly specific for glycoproteins (GP) that viral envelopes. Viral particles are thereby captured and their concentration in blood is significantly reduced [9]. This process, called \u2018Lectin Affinity Plasmapheresis', is based on the concept of affinity chromatography developed in the 1970s [10]. A unique lectin protein (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA) from Galanthus nivalis (the common snowdrop) has a high affinity to the mannose-rich GP that ubiquitously populate the surface of enveloped viruses [11,12] to inter alia mediate entry into host cells. This device has been used either alone or in series with a hemodialyzer and has displayed encouraging results both in vitro and in vivo on hepatitis C and HIV infected blood. Assuming a delicate equilibrium between the viral load and the immunological system, the eradication of a viral infection may be realized only by tipping the balance in favor of the innate immune response by lowering the circulating viral particle concentration in blood.\n\nUnlike the Hemopurifier's invetors' own claims, this review doesn't mention respiratory viruses as a likely (useful) target. (It only mentioned Ebola, Hep C, and HIV.)\n\nI [found](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/30/suppl_3/iii229/2512298) the (2015) scientific publication on the Eblola experiment now too; it mainly uses the generic name of the method \"Lectin Affinity Plasmapheresis\" (LAP), although Hemopurifier is mentioned in there. This paper is not indexed by pubmed; I think it's because it's a conference rather than a journal paper.\n\nThere's a [more recent (2018) paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698959) testing LAP (in vitro) on MERS, which is indexed in pubmed though. The fact that most of these papers appear in rather niche *methods* publications like the *Blood Purif.* journal should tell you something though.\n", "22931": "The NEJM [editorial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2005477?query=recirc_curatedRelated_article) that accompanied that issue says:\n\n> One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more [in-depth investigations](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/46/12997), including a theoretical Thai [study of how](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094092/) of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:\n\n> it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS\u2013LPV) and ritonavir (SARS\u2013RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. \n>\n> [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. \"Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors\" J Theor Biol. \n\nIt's \"above my pay grade\" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:\n\n> Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).\n\nAs noted [on Protopedia](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Flaps_Morph_for_HIV_Protease)\n\n>  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.\n>\n> The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two \"flaps\". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to \"lock\" the flaps closed.\n\nSo I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.\n\nThere seem to be other researchers who have [considered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17605471?dopt=Abstract) this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:\n\n> One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. \n\nThere's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out [already](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009) (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:\n\n>  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.\n\nHowever, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:\n\n> results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.\n>\n> To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S\u202f=\u202f\u221212.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, [ML188](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569073/) did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S\u202f=\u202f\u22128.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). \n\nThis paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. [Nelfinavir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelfinavir) is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because [there are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Antiretroviral_drug) at least six \"1st gen\" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some \"2nd gen\" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.\n\n", "21698": "Update: April 2 [news](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52126735) is that the WHO has now commissioned a panel to study the problem further:\n\n> Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus?\n>\n> This question is to be assessed by a panel of advisers to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n>\n> The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; [a study](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4756) in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m.\n>\n> The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks.\n>\n> The former director at the WHO explained: \"The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used.\"\n\n\nOriginal answer below:\n\n---\n\nThe effectiveness of masks in the general population, as opposed to use by HCW (health-case workers) has not been studied a lot. Some such studies involved \"home use\" which may or may not be equivalent to \"going shopping\" use, so we don't have a lot of clear data on how people might be using masks in the present pandemic.\n\nBut some facts that [were reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4868614/)...\n\n> In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve.\n\nThere was no clear idea how to design masks at that point, a \"germ-proof\" surgical mask was only [available](https://doi.org/10.1086/647501) from the 1930s onward.\n\nAnd some \"home use\" RCTs; [MacIntyre et al. (2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/)\n\n> We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial comparing surgical masks, non\u2013fit-tested P2 masks, and no masks in prevention of influenza-like illness (ILI) in households. [...] Adherence to mask use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ILI-associated infection. We concluded that **household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI. If adherence were greater, mask use might reduce transmission during a severe influenza pandemic.**\n\n[Cowling et al. (2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19652172/)\n\n> INTERVENTION: Lifestyle education (control) (134 households), hand hygiene (136 households), or surgical facemasks plus hand hygiene (137 households) for all household members.\n>\n> RESULTS: Sixty (8%) contacts in the 259 households had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection in the 7 days after intervention. **Hand hygiene with or without facemasks seemed to reduce influenza transmission**, but the differences compared with the control group were not significant. In 154 households in which interventions were implemented within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, **transmission of** RT-PCR-**confirmed infection seemed reduced, an effect attributable to fewer infections among participants using facemasks plus hand hygiene** [...]. Adherence to interventions varied.\n\nBasically, masks can work for the \"average Joe\" but note that some effect of hand hygiene was observed even without masks, but not vice-versa.\n\nHere's the full summary table from the review of [MacIntyre and Chughtai (2015)](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694) on household/community settings studies. (Paper found by Vladimir F.)\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\nAs you can see, most report no significant differences for masks alone. The review says that a meta-analysis is not possible due to varying study design(s). It also says the studies may have been underpowered. They discuss the studies in a bit more detail (including the two I've already mentioned above). Since the ones inside a household are pretty similar to each other, let me quote just what they say on two studies on a slightly different setting:\n\n> Two RCTs in university residence halls in the United\nStates over two influenza seasons randomised well students\ninto medical masks plus hand hygiene, medical\nmasks alone, or control. **Influenza-like illness and\nlaboratory confirmed influenza were not significantly\nreduced after either intervention, although during the first\nfour to six weeks, influenza-like illness was significantly\nlower in the medical masks plus hand hygiene arm in\nboth trials (P<0.05). This suggests that hand hygiene\nmight have been the major contributor to protection.**\n\n(Those are the two studies by Aiello et al. [2010, 2012] in that big table.)\n\nThe review also says:\n\n> The routine use of facemasks is not recommended by WHO,\nthe CDC, or the ECDC in the community setting. However,\n[citing the same guidelines] the use of facemasks is recommended in crowded settings\n(such as public transport) and for those at high risk\n(older people, pregnant women, and those with a medical\ncondition) during an outbreak or pandemic.\n\nHowever... looking at the actual sources cited [2009 CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm) and [2006 WHO paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291414/)... what they actually say (the CDC in particular) is that *both* criteria (crowded setting and vulnerable person) have to be met simultaneously for the mask to be recommended.\n\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7xvx.png\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxGl4.png", "21717": "This answer was written on Mar.&nbsp;25; things can change quickly.

He may have experience working within the field of medicine but he is a medical negligence lawyer, not a medical practitioner, as highlighted by [his George Washington University Law page][5]\n\nThe idea of using an oxygen and air supply is \"thinking outside the box\" but not viable from my knowledge of CPAP/APAP machines. CPAP and APAP machines take air from the surrounding air through a filter on the side of the machine.\n\nTake for example, my CPAP machine air intake photographed in this image\n\n[![CPAP air intake][6]][6]\n\nThere is no way of connecting a bottled oxygen and air supply to this air inlet.\n\n## Using oxygen and air supply between the machine and mask\n\nYou said in the comments:\n>I checked that as well and there is an easy way to connect oxygen. If the CPAP is not oxygen compatible, you can add an oxygen bleed adaptor between the machine tubing and the mask tubing.\n\nIf you are looking to add oxygen within the air supplied to the patient, you are correct that [you can connect an adaptor][7] between the machine and the tubing to the mask.\n\nIf you are wanting to maintain a specific oxygen concentration, the way CPAP/APAP machines work is different to hospital ICU (Intensive Care Unit) ventilators.\n\n>Ventilators employed in NIV [Non-Invasive Ventilation] range from ICU ventilators with full monitoring and alarm systems normally employed in the intubated patient, to light weight, free standing devices with limited alarm systems specifically designed for non-invasive respiratory support. Life support ICU ventilators separate the inspiratory and expiratory gas mixtures. This prevents rebreathing and allows monitoring of inspiratory pressure and exhaled minute ventilation on which monitoring and alarm limits are based (British Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee, 2002).\n\n## References\n\nBritish Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee.

It is considered that an increase of PBM by one standard deviation would reduce the fracture risk by 50%.[Link][2]\n\nThe risk of fracture is determined largely by bone density, which is the end result of peak value achieved at skeletal maturity and subsequent age- and menopause-related bone loss. The risk of osteoporotic fracture at any site relates to bone mineral density at that site and the amount of stress applied to that bone.[Link][3]\n\n\n>It is commonly accepted that development of a higher peak bone mass during adolescent years protects against postmenopausal osteoporosis. There is a strong inverse relationship between bone mineral density and incidence of fracture in postmenopausal women. Bone loss in a postmenopausal woman with low peak bone density will have greater consequences for fracture than that in a woman with higher peak bone mineral density.[Link][4]\n\nAs mentioned in [Cochrane][5], exercise will improve bone mineral density just slightly so it can reduce the chance of having a fracture to some extent.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_bone_mass\n  [2]: https://scielosp.org/article/spm/2009.v51suppl1/s5-s17/en/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8499027\n  [4]: https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/6/1839/2864329\n  [5]: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000333/MUSKEL_exercise-for-preventing-and-treating-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women", "21079": "In treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the following immunosuppressants, which are already in use, inhibit cytokines:\n\n - Non-biologic DMARDs (Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs): [methotrexate][1], [leflunomide][2], [hydroxychloroquine][3], [sulfasalazine][4], [cyclosporine][5], and [tacrolimus][6]\n - [Biologic DMARDs][7]: adalimubab, anakinra, certolizumab, etanercept, golimubab, infliximab, etc.\n\nBiologic DMARDs are not the first choice in treatment of RA because they: \n\n - are expensive\n - cannot be taken by mouth (because they contain antibodies, which are proteins)\n - can have severe side effects (thrombosis, liver and kidney toxicity, demyelinating disorders...)\n - increase the risk of infections (pneumonia, skin infections, the reactivation of tuberculosis or hepatitis B...)\n - **usually do not induce remission,** unlike methotrexate and sulfasalazine ([Emedicine][8])\n\n[Emedicine][8] (free registering required) and [John Hopkins Medicine][9] cover drugs used in treatment of RA, including DMARDs, one by one in detail (mechanism of action, dosing, clinical effectiveness, side effects).\n\nMost drugs mentioned here are included in [2015 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis][11].\n\n\n  [1]: https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/42/10/1189/1784701\n  [2]: https://www.jimmunol.org/content/165/10/5962\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3674253/\n  [4]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/sulfasalazine\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10685792\n  [6]: https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/43/8/992/1784457\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507863/\n  [8]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331715-treatment#d13\n  [9]: https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-treatment/\n  [10]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165%2F00003495-200262060-00003\n  [11]: https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/ACR%202015%20RA%20Guideline.pdf", "20876": "A [double-blind crossover study][1] of placebo and the antiestrogen tamoxifen in ten men with gynecomastia of diverse etiology showed that:\n>The reduction of breast size was partial and may indicate the need for a longer course of therapy.

People in an incredible amount of pain most often endure it without passing out. Others pass out at the sight of a drop of blood (a classmate of mine in medical school, every single time), the sight of a needle (a man in the ED who was about to get stitches), the sight of a child's minor injury (my friend whose daughter sustained a minor laceration at my house) or for other reasons.\n\nIf you see a theme here, that's part of the answer.\n\nNeurocardiogenic syncope (NS) is the most common cause for loss of consciousness.  Basically what that means is that fainting is caused by the nervous system slowing the heart rate down (in the presence of venous dilation) to the point that not enough blood is being pumped to the brain to keep someone conscious. These people fall, usually to the ground, where they regain consciousness as the heart rate increases and more blood is made available to get more oxygen to the brain.\n\n>[Neurocardiogenic syncope](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8528491) is a collective term used to describe the clinical syndromes of syncope that result from inappropriate, and often excessive, autonomic reflex activity, and manifest as abnormalities in the control of vascular tone and heart rate. These include carotid sinus syndrome, vasovagal syncope, and the syndromes of cough, deglutition, and micturition syncope. \n\nThe vagus nerve can be stimulated by fear (including fear of pain.)\n\nVagus nerve stimulation causes (among other things) a [decreased heart rate](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-physiology/article/effects-of-direct-sympathetic-and-vagus-nerve-stimulation-on-the-physiology-of-the-whole-heart-a-novel-model-of-isolated-langendorff-perfused-rabbit-heart-with-intact-dual-autonomic-innervation/BBC94C4AE2EA69F2128B1173E797431C) and a [decrease in cardiac muscle contractility](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00547.x).\n\nHowever, pain causes the opposite effect:\n\n>[Pain](https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/108/5/838/266506) stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn increases heart rate (HR) and causes peripheral vasoconstriction.\n\nIt also increases the contractility of heart muscle (it is a [positive inotrope](https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/cpd-and-learning/learning-article/use-of-inotropes-in-critical-care/11049283.article?firstPass=false).)\n\nTo (over)simplify, mild fear in susceptible people stimulates the vagus nerve to the point of causing decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in passing out. Pain, however, causes a sympathetic output which counteracts (and inhibits) the fear driven vagal effects on the heart. The more adrenaline and noradrenaline pain causes, the less likely the person is to pass out from pain.\n\nPersonal experience:\n\nIn all of my years as an ER doctor, I have never seen anyone pass out (or give a history of passing out) from pain, and I have seen all kinds of pain of every severity. \n\n<sub>Recently I sustained a severe (comminuted, displaced) fracture of my lower leg. Without any pain management, an orthopedic resident pulled, twisted, pushed and otherwise manipulated my leg for about 20 minutes to try to align the fracture better in anticipation of surgery the next day.

Because they were still crushed, there wasn't sufficient blood loss to cause her to pass out, and **she directed her own rescue to the paramedics** (ED doctors give what's referred to as \"medical command\" verbally to paramedics in the field.

Bacteria\n> grow rapidly at temperatures between 40 \u00b0F and 140 \u00b0F; cooked potatoes\n> should be discarded if left out for more than 2 hours at room\n> temperature.\n\nSo when you get up in the morning and discover a potato in the oven, the only safe thing to do is toss it. Considering that a potato costs about 15 cents (US) in most of the world, why would you risk otherwise?\n\n\n  [1]: https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/32167/can-adequate-heating-transform-spoiled-food-into-safe-food\n  [2]: https://ucanr.edu/sites/MFPOC/Food_Safety/Botulism/", "19692": "**There is no convincing evidence to say that any specific diet is more beneficial than others for *all people.* On the other hand, there is enough evidence to say that a certain diet change can be beneficial for a *particular person.***\n\n**Example 1: Sugar-free diet and weight loss**\n\nAccording to two study reviews ([Nutrients, 2017][1], [Wiley, 2012][2]), no *specific* diet is better for weight loss than other diets, but every *hypocaloric* diet is good. \n\nOn the other hand, if you, for example, consume a lot of sugar, you can gain excessive weight, not because of sugar, but because of excessive calorie intake ([BMJ, 2013][3]). Calories also come from fats, proteins and alcohol, but if you are [addicted to sugar][4], the main reason for your weight gain is probably sugar. In this case, it is quite likely you will lose weight much easier by a sugar-free diet than by other diets.\n\n**Example 2: Gluten-free diet and placebo effect**\n\nGluten-free diet is obviously beneficial for people with celiac disease ([Celiac Disease Foundation][5]).\n\nThere is another condition called [non-celiac gluten sensitivity][6]; the affected people report improvement of symptoms after starting gluten-free diet ([Celiac Disease Foundation][7]). There is no test to prove non-celiac gluten sensitivity, so it is not clear if it even exists; it could be a psychosomatic disorder similar to irritable bowel syndrome, and a gluten-free diet could just act as a placebo. \n\nIn conclusion, a specific diet does not have an inherent ability to be beneficial for everyone, but it can be good for someone, because foods can have different effects on different people. Saying that, often, a perceived benefit of a special diet is just an illusion. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579615/\n  [2]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2001.113\n  [3]: https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7492\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234835/\n  [5]: https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182669/\n  [7]: https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/related-conditions/non-celiac-wheat-gluten-sensitivity/", "19685": "Your back-of-the-envelope calculations seem to be off in estimating the extent of viral load reduction in a treated versus untreated person as well as the risk of transmission for unprotected, untreated sex (5% is much higher than any other number I have seen).\n\n> Obviously the viral load is not zero because then they wouldn't be HIV positive\n\nis not accurate. Current antiretroviral therapies are able to reduce serum HIV concentrations to be below detectable limits. That doesn't make them HIV-negative, because they still have HIV infections in their cells and their serum would test positive if they stopped antiretroviral use (i.e., they are not cured).\n\nIn 1238 couple-years, zero transmissions occurred with condomless sex (estimated 58,000 sexual interactions without a condom including both heterosexual couples and homosexual males) when the HIV-positive partner was on antiretroviral therapy *to the extent that they did not have detectable serum concentrations of virus* (Rodger et al, 2016). This is a sufficient observation period to make the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval =0.30/100.\n\nYou are correct that this does not mean the risk is zero, but it is very low; several people involved in that study *did* become HIV-positive during the study but for all of them this was through sex with additional partners not part of the antiretroviral treatment.\n\nThis study and others like it should not necessarily be interpreted as meaning that safer sex practices are unnecessary when HIV is suppressed to undetectable levels, but they speak to the efficacy of those drugs for prevention. One limitation the authors note is that because anal sex with ejaculation is associated with higher transmission rates than other types of sex, and since their study was not limited to that particular act:\n\n> despite an observed transmission rate of zero for this risk behavior, a clinically important rate of less than 2.2 per 100 couple-years of follow-up cannot be excluded. This translates into an upper limit estimate of 20% risk over 10 years.\n\n(note this is still an upper limit estimate...further study may bring that upper limit downward; *edit: there is a further follow up from this study published June 2019, [Rodger et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673619304180), focusing on condomless anal sex between men; they continued to not find any cases of partner to partner transmission with antiretroviral treatment allowing them to decrease the upper CI to 0.23 per 100 couple years* for the sex act known to be of highest risk for transmission without treatment)\n\nSerodiscordant couples will need to interpret for themselves how to respond to these risks, and from a broader standpoint other issues like the consistent use of prescribed drugs are also relevant. Cohen et al, 2016 used an intention-to-treat design to study a similar question, and found several partner transmissions (fewer when treatment was started earlier), but none of these where in cases where the positive partner had undetectable serum levels, which was likely because the person chose not to take the drug for whatever reason (and still the infection rates between partners were very low than without antiretroviral treatment).\n\nA meta analysis by LeMessurier et al, 2018 found \"no transmissions with antiretroviral therapy and a viral load of less than 200 copies/mL.\"\n\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n[Rodger, A.

Although a lot of the sequelae are related to elevated glucose levels, diabetes is a complex metabolic dysregulation that has many other factors involved.  The pathogenesis of diabetes differs between types, they are really quite different diseases, so I will focus primarily on type 2 diabetes (the most common and the most metabolically complex).\n\nSome things to consider that will help frame your understanding:\n\n- Look at the association between dysfunction in insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol and fat metabolism, protein metabolism, and inflammation in the spectrum of [endocrine dysfunction in **metabolic syndrome.**][1]  It is clear that it's not just sugar that's out of balance in the process of type 2 diabetes / insulin resistance.\n\n- Look at the [**complexity of the pathophysiology of renal dysfunction**][2] in diabetes, and how much is involved beyond just glycosylation from elevated glucose.\n\n- Consider insulin: the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes centers on insulin resistance, and often individuals have elevated fasting insulin and high spikes in insulin.  The **insulin molecule has [fairly broad metabolic activities][3] on its own** - from fat metabolism to inflammation to protein turnover to vasodilation... so persistently elevated or high spiking insulin levels have metabolic consequences that are independent from glucose levels.  \n\nBut from what we know in studies, a healthier a1c (the indicator of average blood sugar) [correlates with better outcomes][4].  Maintaining normal levels of blood sugar (not just a1c which looks at the average BG but true normal including normal range postprandial levels etc) brings the risk of most macro and microvascular complications down to near what it would be if you didn't have diabetes.  Again, it appears that although much of that is due to the blood glucose levels, a good part is that the other metabolic dysregulations improve along with improving blood glucose levels.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/165124-overview#a3\n  [2]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/238946-overview#a3\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525983/\n  [4]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1056872716303026", "19603": "The sensationalist press release for a *small* study does *not* warrant to conclude that \n\n> Ecdysterone supplementation has been shown to have a significant anabolic effect\n\nWhile some previous studies have indicated that there [may][1] be an effect in cells, tissues and animals, previous human studies measured the effect for \"gaining muscle\" at *zero!*   \n<sub>(Wilborn: [\"Effects of Methoxyisoflavone, Ecdysterone, and Sulfo-Polysaccharide Supplementation on Training Adaptations in Resistance-Trained Males\"][2], 2006.)</sub>\n\nThe study now circulated is not only *very* small and didn't account for actual bio-availability of the claimed to fame substance. Further, there are more than 400 substances in this class of ectosteroids identified so far. Which one or which combination of them was used in this particular study or all the others is difficult to ascertain and compare in an SE overview answer.\n\nIt also did not explain how the alleged effect should be explained compared to control and placebo results. Unless replicated, the current study is \"interesting\", and has no real-life value  \u2013 so far.\n\nThe main author of this study gives a lengthy interview (in German) acknowledging quite a few of the limitations of this study and its results [in a podcast][3] (at 1:34:00 he can be quoted with \"with *hard* training  we saw a small effect\" / \"don't take supplements\"). Coincidentally the manufacturer selling 6mg as 100mg seems to have pulled the product from the market. Whether the heightened awareness due to the study or the many negative testimonials for products claiming this as an ingredient  ([example][4]) or plain quality issues remains an open speculative question.\n\nOne big weakness is then that a very preliminary safety assessment was made looking at a few liver parameters.

That's laudable in itself, for such a study, but not enough.\n\nAs among the concerns of \"[promotes growth][5]\" (what \"growth\", cancer?) the substance is assumed to act on certain receptors\n\n> but it is rather exhibited by the activation of the estrogen receptor beta. \n\nAnd longer term kidney health was not monitored in the new study. \n\nWell, that might mean really bad news, everyone.\n\n> Minglei Lu: [\"Activation of mineralocorticoid receptor by ecdysone, an adaptogenic and anabolic ecdysteroid, promotes glomerular injury and proteinuria involving overactive GSK3\u03b2 pathway signaling\"][6], Scientific Reportsvolume 8, Article number: 12225 (2018) \n\nIt seems a rather prudent meaure of supplement vendors to not really rip off consumers by selling them 100mg ecdysterone caps that only contain 6mg (Isenmann). That's actually consumer protection! As now the alleged effects of the supplement should be obtainable with the equivalent of 250 mg of regular spinach. Or some insects, as they contain this steroid hormone, and need it.\n\n> [Most Internet claims for \u2018spectacular\u2019 effects of ecdysteroids on humans and other mammals are unsubstantiated or apocryphal.][7] However, most reports in the scientific literature have demonstrated that the pharmacological effects of ecdysteroids in mammals are positive, and it is clear that ecdysteroids may influence/improve many physiological functions. Unfortunately, no extensive, systematic trials on any mammalian species have been published. Dietary intake of ecdysteroids is possible but limited for most humans, since the crop species which contain phytoecdysteroids are not extensively eaten. Thus, there may be a future for ecdysteroids as dietary supplements to contribute to human well-being (as \u2018adaptogenic\u2019 substances). **However, more study is required to elucidate the metabolism of exogenous ecdysteroids in mammals and the biochemical modes of action of the parent ecdysteroids and their metabolites.** Such studies are also important to underpin the use of ecdysteroid-induced gene switches. These systems possess considerable potential for basic biological studies of gene function and in gene therapy.\n\nA quite recent summary of the sparse overall evidence for human application is found in\n\n\n> We briefly summarise the many attributed positive pharmaceutical effects of ecdysteroids in vertebrates (especially humans) and critically assess the reports associating ecdysteroids with cancer and embryotoxicity and the probable use of ecdysteroids as doping substances for athletes. We stress the need for much more extensive research into the metabolism and mode of action of ecdysteroids particularly in mammals. The presence of natural and, increasingly, man-made ecdysteroid agonists and antagonists may have considerable impact on the environ- ment. On the one hand, non-steroidal (ant)agonists offer considerable promise as environmentally friendlier, more selective pesticides, but, on the other hand, could become endocrine disruptors of non-target species, especially in aquatic ecosystems. We consider in some depth the development of strategies for the identification and environmental monitoring of potential endocrine disruptors affecting ecdysteroid hormonal systems in invertebrates and emphasise the overwhelming need for basic research into the endocrinology of aquatic invertebrates which would be suitable as signal species.    \n>\n> possible harmful effects of ecdysteroids on vertebrates had to be deter- mined, and these molecules have shown very low, if any, toxicity when ingested by mammals: acute toxicity value of 20-hydroxyecdysone for mice after oral adminis- tration could not be determined (so the LD50 is >9 g/kg body weight), whereas that after intraperitoneal injections LD50 was as high as 6.4 g/kg (Ogawa et al., 1974b).\n>\n> tandard tests with pure molecules are needed to fully establish the lack of toxicity after daily administration over a long period (90-day test) (see also this [PDF][8]). Such experiments would allow the removal of ecdysone from the Carcinogenic Potency Database (http://potency.berkeley.edu). Anyway, lack of toxicity does not mean lack of pharmacological effects (see above).\n>\n> The reported effects of ecdysteroids on tumorous cell induction/proliferation are conflicting (Table 23.2). Experiments are difficult to compare, as they differ in the molecules used (ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone or other ecdysteroids), their concentrations, their purity, the assays used (in vitro/in vivo) and their duration. Thus, Burdette and Richards (1961) observed proliferation-inhibitory effects on sarcoma cells in vitro, but they used a semi-purified extract from silkworm pupae (ecdysone?). Later investigations with crystalline ecdysteroids obtained from plants showed no effects (Burdette, 1974b). Lagova and Valueva (1981) found that 20-hydroxyecdysone (0.1\u2013300mg/kg daily subcutaneous injections for 5 days) was ineffective on the growth of several tumour types, whereas it stimulated that of mammary gland carcinomas. El-Mofty et al. (1987, 1994) reported that ecdysone was able to induce neoplastic lesions in toads and mice; surprisingly, these results were obtained with very low amounts of ecdysone (i.e. only 1\u03bcg/mouse (!) given orally twice a week for 22 months) and they are therefore difficult to reconcile with the data of other authors who used amounts several (2\u20134) orders of magnitude higher (albeit for shorter durations, e.g. 35 days) without observing any adverse effects (e.g. Ogawa et al., 1974b).\n>\n> These anabolic effects were first described in mice/rats and resulted in increased physical performance/endurance (Syrov, 2000). They have also been observed in humans, according to the few clinical experiments, the details of which are not readily available (Lafont and Dinan, 2003).\n>\n> The availability of other purified ecdysteroids is, however, seriously limited, and the few which are available are very expensive. The recent availability of large amounts of 20E has been driven by the belief that ecdysteroids possess anabolic properties (which has not been conclusively demonstrated in clinical trials, although a growing body of cir- cumstantial evidence exists) and the wish by many to exploit this. As a consequence, 20E is now a component of a very large number of preparations available over the Web (see Ecdybase), targeted at body-builders, sportsmen, health fanatics and their pets. These formulations incorporate purified 20E, or semi-purified ecdysteroid-containing plant extracts, together with other components; only in one product is 20E the only \u2018active\u2019 ingredient. Recommended doses have increased over time from 5 mg/pill in 1995 up to 300 mg/soft gel at the present. It is not clear if this reflects a reassessment of the required dosage, or the greater availability of 20E. One must also question the claimed amount of ecdysteroid present in the preparations, since Jadhav et al. (2007) found much lower levels than those claimed.\n>\n> <sub>\u2013\u2013 Ren\u00e9 Lafont & Laurence Dinan: \"Innovative and Future Applications for Ecdysteroids\", in: Guy Smagghe (Ed): \"Ecdysone: Structures and Functions\", Springer, 2009.</sub>  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4447764/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129166/\n  [3]: https://www.damienzaid.de/2019/07/01/ecdysteron/\n  [4]: https://books.google.com/books?id=yI1oNneR6zkC&lpg=PT145&ots=-ml4XB3c0Y&dq=ecdysterone&pg=PT145\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18444661\n  [6]: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29483-7\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17065383?dopt=Abstract\n  [8]: http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/CompMed/PIL/IJEACCM/2/Ecdysterone.pdf", "18340": "[Gary Taubes][1], the journalist and advocate,  did publish such an article:\n\nGary Taubes: \"The Soft Science of Dietary Fat\", Science, New Series, Vol. 291, No. 5513 (Mar. 30, 2001), pp. 2536-2541+2543-2545 ([jstor][2]) (available [at the author's page][3])\n\nIn that article, which is solidly written but not a study, more of an opinion piece, the author argues mainly against dietary advice given out despite being far less clear-cut than it ought to be for that kind of intervention. He does not prove anything in that paper, but merely discusses the pros and cons of the issue. That is by far more nuanced what the claimant in question seems to read into and out of it.\n\nFor the claim Jerzy Zi\u0119ba makes, one might have to look a bit closer at what Taubes writes, or draws:\n\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]    \n\n> The data were consistent: When investigators tracked all deaths, instead of just heart disease deaths, the cholesterol curves were U-shaped for men and flat for women. In other words, men with cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dl tended to die prematurely from heart disease. But below 160 mg/dl, the men tended to die prematurely from cancer, respiratory and digestive and trauma. As for women, if diseases, anything, the higher their cholesterol, the longer they lived (see graph on p. 2540).  \n>\n> These mortality data can be interpreted in two ways. One, preferred by low-fat advocates, is that they cannot be meaningful. Rifkind, for instance, told Science that the excess deaths at low cholesterol levels must be due to preexisting conditions. In other words, chronic illness leads to low cholesterol levels, not vice versa. He pointed to the 1990 conference report as the definitive document on the issue and as support for his argument, although the report states unequivocally that this interpretation is not supported by the data.\n>\n> The other interpretation is that what a low-fat diet does to serum cholesterol levels, and what that in turn does to arteries, may be only one component of the diet's effect on health. In other words, while low-fat diets might help prevent heart disease, they might also raise susceptibility to other conditions. This is what always worried Ahrens. It's also one reason why the American College of Physicians, for instance, now suggests that cholesterol reduction is certainly worth while for those at high, short-term risk of dying of coronary heart disease but of \"much smaller or ...\nuncertain benefit for everyone else.\n\nFor a very general assessment of Taubes' work, we might look at his concepts of obesity, how it develops and what to do about that:\n\n> However, *some* of the conclusions that the author reaches are not consistent with current concepts about obesity.    \n> <sub>[Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes; New York: AA Knopf \u2013\u2013 Review by GA BRay][5] ([DOI][6])</sub>\n\nAnd with regards to cholesterol levels, the information from Taubes is quoted really unfortunate. As I read it he still doesn't say that very high blood cholesterol is \"healthy\", and the author merely argues that the possible dangers associated with it were overestimated in the past.

Therefore, it seems that increased blood circulation that accompanies functional brain activation removes heat from the brain\n\n \n \n \n - brain circulation is a significant factor in the re-distribution of locally released heat within brain tissue and in its removal from the brain, thus contributing to brain temperature fluctuations occurring under behavioral conditions.\n \n \n - By increasing blood flow above the brain\u2019s current demand, more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the areas of potential demand and more potentially dangerous metabolic heat is removed from intensively working brain tissue.\u00a0\n\n\n**More dorsally located structures were consistently cooler**\n\n\n(I added this thing as I thought it was interesting here as it's opposite of what OP had in question, however, that was surface temperature)\n \n - Tested at the same conditions, more dorsally located structures were consistently cooler (dorsal striatum, 36.6\u00b0C; hippocampus, 35.6\u00b0C) than more ventrally located structures (ventral tegmental area of midbrain, 37.3\u00b0C; medial preoptic area of hypothalamus, 37.3\u00b0C; nucleus accumbens or NAcc, 37.3\u00b0C).\u00a0\n\n\nIn Conclusion,\nin contrast to general beliefs that brain temperature is a stable, tightly regulated homeostatic parameter, data presented in this review demonstrate a relatively wide range of fluctuations (~3\u00b0C) occurring in rats following exposure to salient somato-sensory stimuli and during various motivated behaviors. Although rats and humans have obvious differences in temperature regulation and human data are very limited, similarity between rats and monkeys in general patterns of brain temperature fluctuations may support the findings.\n\n**References**\n1.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149793/#!po=22.6852\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149793/#!po=22.6852\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3149793_nihms312586f2.jpg", "18566": "Sumatriptan activates *vascular* [5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors][1].  This results in vasoconstriction, which is what is thought to help the migraines.  This is the same idea for giving caffeine, which is also a vasoconstrictor.  Taking tryptophan would likely be ineffective for a variety of reasons in terminating a migraine.  First, it would have to be ingested and absorbed, which takes time, and then it would have to be metabolized to 5-HT ([Serotonin][2]).  Even if tryptophan was absorbed in the stomach, it would be ineffective at terminating the migraine in a timely fashion and thus not well tolerated by a patient.\n\nSecond, there is little evidence that oral tryptophan supplementation increases serotonin levels ([Cynober et al., 2016][3]).\n\n[Cynober et al. (2016)][3] states that the subjects urinated out the tryptophan in a \"dose dependent fashion.\"  Further, there was no significant change in their mood with tryptophan supplementation at any dose.  This suggests that the tryptophan is not being metabolized into 5-HT.  This makes sense, since tryptophan is in our diets, and it would be wild to think that our bodies didn't regulate 5-HT metabolism (that is to say that our bodies just automatically made 5-HT every time we ate something with tryptophan in it).\n\nIf patients do have a serotonin imbalance, it is likely involved in metabolism issues, say some mutation or problem with co-factors or enzymes.  Therefore, tryptophan likely isn't a solution.\n\n## References\n\nCynober, L., Bier, D. M., Kadowaki, M., Morris Jr, S. M., Elango, R., & Smriga, M. (2016).

It is also conserved across species. There is evidence (well summarized in both the narrative review and meta-analysis in [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5400803/)) for an association between consumption of dairy products, increased levels of circulating IGF-1, and downstream effects of that increased level (e.g., prostate cancer).\n\nYou should note that it is not surprising that a hormone produced by another animal would be active in a human. See, [the 1923 Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/banting/facts/).\n\nJust to be clear:\n**This answer addresses the specific two questions posed in the OP: are hormones in milk and milk products active after pasteurization, and are cow hormones active in humans.

At a population level, think of the brain cancers from unnecessary CTs these algorithms are preventing by not scanning every headache or bumped head.

The investigation of a large number of genetic variants covering the *AR* locus suggests that a polyglycine-encoding GGN repeat in exon 1 is a plausible candidate for conferring the functional effect.

Javanese turmeric (Curcuma xanthorrhiz) is a different plant and not discussed in this fact sheet.\n\n> Historically, turmeric has been used in Ayurvedic medicine, primarily in South Asia, for many conditions, including breathing problems, rheumatism, serious pain, and fatigue.\n\n> Today, turmeric is used as a dietary supplement for inflammation; arthritis; stomach, skin, liver, and gallbladder problems; cancer; and other conditions.\nTurmeric is a common spice and a major ingredient in curry powder. Its primary active ingredients, curcuminoids, are yellow and used to color foods and cosmetics.\n\n> Turmeric\u2019s underground stems (rhizomes) are dried and made into capsules, tablets, teas, or extracts. Turmeric powder is also made into a paste for skin conditions.\n\n\n> **How Much Do We Know?**\n\n> We have a lot of research, including studies done in people, on turmeric for a variety of health conditions.\n\n> **What Have We Learned?**\n\n> ***Claims that curcuminoids found in turmeric help to reduce inflammation aren\u2019t supported by strong studies.***\n\n> ***Preliminary* studies found that curcuminoids may**\n\n> - Reduce the number of heart attacks bypass patients had after surgery\n- Control knee pain from osteoarthritis as well as ibuprofen did\n- Reduce the skin irritation that often occurs after radiation treatments for breast cancer.\n- Other preliminary studies in people have looked at curcumin, a type of curcuminoid, for different cancers, colitis, diabetes, surgical pain, and as an ingredient in mouthwash for reducing plaque.\n- The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has studied curcumin for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and prostate and colon cancer.\n\n> **What Do We Know About Safety?**   \nTurmeric in amounts tested for health purposes is generally considered safe when taken by mouth or applied to the skin.\nHigh doses or long-term use of turmeric may cause gastrointestinal problems.\n\n> [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, 2016][3]\n\n\nOr to put more bluntly, \n\n> - There is little reliable evidence to support the use of turmeric for any health condition because few clinical trials have been conducted.\n\n> *Preliminary* findings from animal and other laboratory studies *suggest* that a chemical found in turmeric \u2014 called curcumin \u2014 may have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties, but these findings have not been confirmed in people. (As quoted from [Turmeric: Tasty in Curry, Questionable as Medicine][4], 2014)\n\nThe above is not meant to wholly dismiss curcuma, or the question, but a reminder to see it as [Turmeric: lots of potential, but beware of the hype][5].\n\nAs the question is quite broad and about a lot of those substances or preparations, let me close with: digestion, metabolism etc. at night time are different. That probably effects bioavailability and pharmacodynamics a lot. I suspect that it is the effect or the same effect size for all the substances mentioned.\n\nAlthough that is speculation, it is also the current line of inquiry for researchers:\n\n> Further randomized, double blinded clinical trials with a greater sample size, homogenous test and tasks of cognitive or memory function, as well as longer duration of treatment and follow-up are compulsory to achieve more conclusive results.

This suggests that **final heart failure is the cause of death rather than cerebral or pulmonary dysfunction**. Results from human and animal experiments and observations under true and simulated microgravitational conditions confirm this assumption, suggesting that a **prolonged, markedly elevated burden of work for the heart because of increased volume load in an inverted body position eventually leads to death by heart failure**. Other mechanisms, such as suffocation (\u201cpositional asphyxia\u201d), reduced blood reflux to the heart attributable to vanishing of blood in the venous system, decreased oxygen supply to the brain after reduced arteriovenous pressure difference, and carotid sinus or baroreceptor reflexes, as well as other factors, seem to play only a minor role, if any, in deaths in head-down position.\n", "17059": "There are reasons why eating 200 g of nuts as the sole food at one meal could be questionable:\n\n - [200 g of dry roasted mixed nuts][1] contains 1188 Calories.

However, when I read the \"burning off tastebuds\" in title of your question, what came to mind was the *real* reason why I use alcoholic mouthwash -- for *that* sensation that comes around after 30 seconds of swishing it around in your mouth. I wouldn't quite call it *burning off your tastebuds*, but it does feel like I've burned something. \n\nIn which case the use of alcoholic mouthwash is a risk factor for oral cancer. This interesting paper looked a genetic polymorphisms involved in alcohol metabolism as well:\n\n> [**Oral health, dental care and mouthwash associated with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk in Europe: The ARCAGE study**][1]\n\n> *Objective* We aimed to assess the association of oral health (OH), dental care (DC) and mouthwash with upper-aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer risk, and to examine the extent that enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol modify the effect of mouthwash.\n\n> *Materials and methods* The study included 1963 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx or esophagus and 1993 controls. Subjects were interviewed about their oral health and dental care behaviors (which were converted to scores of OH and DC respectively), as well as smoking, alcohol drinking, diet, occupations, medical conditions and socio-economic status. Blood samples were taken for genetic analyses. Mouthwash use was analyzed in relation to the presence of polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing genes known to be associated with UADT. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95%-confidence intervals [CI] were estimated with multiple logistic regression models adjusting for multiple confounders.\n\n> *Results* Fully adjusted ORs of low versus high scores of DC and OH were 2.36[CI\u2005=\u20051.51\u20133.67] and 2.22[CI\u2005=\u20051.45\u20133.41], respectively, for all UADT sites combined. **The OR for frequent use of mouthwash use (3 or more times/day) was 3.23[CI\u2005=\u20051.68\u20136.19].** The OR for the rare variant ADH7 (coding for fast ethanol metabolism) was lower in mouthwash-users (OR\u2005=\u20050.53[CI\u2005=\u20050.35\u20130.81]) as compared to never-users (OR\u2005=\u20050.97[CI\u2005=\u20050.73\u20131.29]) indicating effect modification (pheterogeneity\u2005=\u20050.065) while no relevant differences were observed between users and non-users for the variant alleles of ADH1B, ADH1C or ALDH2.\n\n> *Conclusions* Poor OH and DC seem to be independent risk factors for UADT because corresponding risk estimates remain substantially elevated after detailed adjustment for multiple confounders. Whether mouthwash use may entail some risk through the alcohol content in most formulations on the market remains to be fully clarified.\n\n\n###Capsaicin###\n\n\n\nThere's quite a bit of research regarding anti-tumour properties with respect to other forms of cancer e.g. pancreatic cancer, but very little regarding possible risk in oral cancer.\n\nThere is an excerpt from **[*A screening model for oral cancer using risk scores: development and validation*][2]** that does state the following:\n\n> **People who rated the spiciness of their diet as\nsix or more had higher odds (OR = 2.15) for devel-\noping oral cancer than those rating the spiciness as\n\ufb01ve or less.** This is a subjective measure, but it is an\neasier method to collect information on the spici-\nness of food at a population level and in a hospital\nsetting. In India and other South Asian countries,\nred chilli powder or red/green chillies are added\nto increase the spiciness of food. These \ufb01ndings\nsupport the results of other studies conducted in\nIndia that showed red chillies in diet increases the\nrisk by two-three times for UADT cancers includ-\ning oral cancer (31). Similarly, a higher risk has\nbeen observed for gall bladder (32), liver and gas-\ntric cancers (33, 34) in other countries. Although\nthe association of spicy food with oral cancer could\nbe due to the carcinogenicity of capsaicin found in\nchillies (35), it could be a marker for some underly-\ning dietary aspect in this population. \n\nHowever, caution should be exercised when using some score on a questionnaire and attempting to correlate it with health outcomes. There is one study cited above that reports the following:\n\n\n> **[Role of diet in upper aerodigestive tract cancers][3]**\n\n\n> A case\u2010control interview study for assessing the role of dietary factors in selected cancers was undertaken in a hospital. Male patients from one community, with cancers of the oral cavity (n = 278), pharynx (n = 225), esophagus (n = 236), and larynx (n = 80) formed the case group. Patients diagnosedas not having cancer (n = 215) formed one control group, and a comparable sample of individuals from the general population (n = 177) formed another control group. All risks were adjusted for subjects\u2019 ages and habits of chewing and/or smoking tobacco, which are the two most important risk factors for cancers at these sites.\n\n> A protective effect was observed with the intake of vegetables (twofold risk in nondaily vs. daily consumers) and fish (two\u2010 to threefold risk in those who did not eat at least once a week vs. those who did), and to a certain extent with pulses and buttermilk, in comparison with either one or both control groups. Intake of vegetables and fish were also observed to be risk modifiers for those who chewed and/or smoked tobacco. Lower levels of fat consumption was associated with elevated risk levels.\n\n> **The use of red chili powder emerged as a risk factor for all sites (two\u2010 to threefold risk with a dose\u2010response relationship) compared with population controls.** Tea drinking was also observed to be a risk factor for esophageal cancers, and to a lesser extent, for pharyngeal cancers.\n\nUnfortunately, it was published in 1986 and there doesn't seem to be any more literature on the topic. \n\nBut we might presume, sure, it's biologically plausible and there is some evidence that capsaicin increases the risk of oral cancer, while possibly reducing the risk of other cancers.\n\n\n  [1]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2014.03.001\n  [2]: https://doi.org/10.1111/cdoe.12192\n  [3]: https://doi.org/10.1080/01635588709513945", "10434": "To remove the sealant, [probably the most effective way to protect the teeth from caries][1], you need to reapply an acid or remove the superficial sealed enamel.

During long-term intake of more calories than are expended each day, any excess carbohydrate must undergo de novo lipogenesis, which particularly promotes fat accumulation in the liver. Because insulin stimulates de novo lipogenesis, individuals with a degree of insulin resistance (determined by family or lifestyle factors) will accumulate liver fat more readily than others because of higher plasma insulin levels. In turn, the increased liver fat will cause relative resistance to insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production. Over many years, a modest increase in fasting plasma glucose level will stimulate increased basal insulin secretion rates to maintain euglycemia. The consequent hyperinsulinemia will further increase the conversion of excess calories to liver fat. A cycle of hyperinsulinemia and blunted suppression of hepatic glucose production becomes established. Fatty liver leads to increased export of VLDL triacylglycerol,85 which will increase fat delivery to all tissues, including the islets. This process is further stimulated by elevated plasma glucose levels.85 Excess fatty acid availability in the pancreatic islet would be expected to impair the acute insulin secretion in response to ingested food, and at a certain level of fatty acid exposure, postprandial hyperglycemia will supervene. The hyperglycemia will further increase insulin secretion rates, with consequent enhancement of hepatic lipogenesis, spinning the liver cycle faster and driving the pancreas cycle. Eventually, the fatty acid and glucose inhibitory effects on the islets reach a trigger level that leads to a relatively sudden onset of clinical diabetes. \n\nThe observation that bariatric surgery often reversed T2DM was the genesis of this theory, and extreme low calorie diets have confirmed the reversal of T2DM simulating the period of starvation that occurs following bariatric surgery.  Interestingly, even though insulin sensitivity is restored in the liver by calorie loss, it is still present in the peripheral muscles.\n\nAnother recent observation is that [diets high in saturated fat](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/3/723/4569701) predispose to peripheral insulin resistance.\n\n> Conclusions: In a Mediterranean trial focused on dietary fat interventions, baseline intake of saturated and animal fat was not associated with T2D incidence, but the yearly updated intake of saturated and animal fat was associated with a higher risk of T2D. Cheese and butter intake was associated with a higher risk of T2D, whereas whole-fat yogurt intake was associated with a lower risk of T2D.

Sometimes, they can be over-ridden by \"learning\" a different reaction (using similar scenarios). So for example, one might have an involuntary gag-reflex when they consume certain vegetables, but over time, lose sensitivity to those things.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nAlthough you asked about actions, there may be evidence that we can over time change both \"automatic\" actions and thoughts. \"Automatic\" is in quotes here because typically these are behaviors/thoughts that our brains have been trained to perform over a long period of time, and practiced so much that we basically due them by default, and one might argue involuntarily.\n\n\n[Research indicates][2] that many people have subconscious racism, but \n\n> \"habit-breaking intervention allowed individuals to overcome implicit\n> racial bias\"\n\nSince our brains control actions through the motor-cortex, theoretically, there are some actions too which, if the associated neurons pass through your motor-cortex, then by constantly practicing and training your body through mimicking the situation, you may be able to consciously override the default reaction (more easily over time).\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.interactive-biology.com/1698/how-reflexes-work-knee-jerk-and-eye-blink-episode-23/\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603687/", "15369": "Let's first clarify that \"**vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) otherwise known as non-allergic rhinitis**\" is the non-allergic reaction (NAR), which can be similar in symptoms to the allergic reaction (AR), but not the same.\n\n> Vasomotor rhinitis is a poorly understood disorder which mimics many\n> of the symptoms of nasal allergy, but has a completely different\n> basis.

(It breaks down into a statistics problem which we can only approximate with certain assumptions.)\n\nHowever, based on this study:\n[Nonallergic Rhinitis, With a Focus on Vasomotor Rhinitis Clinical Importance, Differential Diagnosis, and Effective Treatment Recommendations][1]\n \n> [One survey of US medical practices] suggest that **at least 57% of rhinitis\n> patients have some\n> contribution from NAR [Nonallergic rhinitis] causing their rhinitis symptoms.** Similar\n> European studies have found that **approximately 1 in 4 patients\n> complaining of nasal symptoms has pure NAR** [2].\n\nSo it seems that people often mix up Allergic Rhinitis (AR) and NAR so much, that even many cases of \"AR\" are actually still just NAR. So maybe people with AR have AR occurances *instead* of NAR, and NAR to NR ratio is about 1-to-1. However, if we assume that all people have relatively the same number of NAR symptoms, then it seems likely that people with AR have at least slightly higher occurances of this symptom.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650992/", "15370": "The question of augmentation-or-prothesis first is difficult to answer, and may even be based on the personal physiology of an individual.

If anything, push your chin down into your chest a little while swallowing (called the \"lean forward method\" in [this article][1], which has other tips as well.)\n- if you are cutting the pill to swallow two small halves, try not doing that - the rough edges of a cut pill add to the difficulty substantially. You may not believe the larger whole pill will be easier to swallow, but it often is\n- ask your pharmacist if you can dissolve the pill in water or mix it in with applesauce or pudding\n\nIf you cannot swallow pills at all, you can learn to do so. ([This literature review][2] found 5 studies that all showed children can be taught to swallow pills.) Here is what worked for me. Start by buying some candy that mimics pill shape. Skittles, M&Ms, or the like are good choices - they have a slightly hard and slippery coating that makes it easier. M & M's have a \"mini\" that is very small and a good one to start with. Choose a candy you like to eat. If you're trying to swallow it and failing, you can always just chew it. (For a small child, I had great success with putting out 5 candies and saying \"once you swallow one whole, the rest are yours to chew.\")\n\nEvery day, try to swallow one of these candies using the tips above. When you can consistently swallow one mini at will, try moving up to the regular size M & M or Skittles. If you can do this then you can take the majority of pills, though ones without a smooth coating will be more difficult. Painkillers like Advil and Tylenol all come in a coated version that is easier to swallow. Many prescription pills are smaller than an M&M or a Skittle, so you will have won most of the battle at this point.\n\nIf you have a large pill that you need to take, you can work your way up to it by practicing with vitamins, which come in a variety of sizes and are safe to take every day. Once you have learned to take a large pill, the skill will stay with you and be useful for decades to come.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/two-tricks-make-easier-swallow-pills-201411137515\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896843", "15056": "If someone feels unwell or headachy after looking at particular patterns, it's likely to be migraine.\n\n> We investigated stripe-induced visual discomfort and its relation to migraine.

Several factors related both to the infant and its environment influence the composition of the intestinal microflora quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Major ecological disturbances are observed in newborn infants treated with antimicrobial agents. **One way of minimizing the ecological disturbances, which may be seen in infants treated in neonatal intensive care units, is to provide them with fresh breast milk from their mothers and to use antimicrobial therapy only under strict clinical indications**.\n\n'[Protective nutrients and bacterial colonization in the immature human gut.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10645469)' describes the role breastfeeding has on infant intestinal microflora. \n\n> The normal human microflora is a complex ecosystem that is in part dependent on enteric nutrients for establishing colonization. The gut microbiota are important to the host with regard to metabolic functions and resistance to bacterial infections. At birth, bacterial colonization of a previously germ-free human gut begins. Diet and environmental conditions can influence this ecosystem. A breast-fed, full-term infant has a preferred intestine microbiota in which bifidobacteria predominate over potentially harmful bacteria, whereas in formula-fed infants, coliforms, enterococci, and bacteroides predominate. The pattern of bacterial colonization in the premature neonatal gut is different from that in the healthy, full-term infant gut. Those infants requiring intensive care acquire intestinal organisms slowly, and the establishment of bifidobacterial flora is retarded. A delayed bacterial colonization of the gut with a limited number of bacterial species tends to be virulent. Bacterial overgrowth is one of the major factors that promote bacterial translocation. The aberrant colonization of the premature infant may contribute to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis. **Breastfeeding protects infants against infection. Oligo-saccharides and glycoconjugates, natural components in human milk, may prevent intestinal attachment of enteropathogens by acting as receptor homologues. Probiotics and prebiotics modulate the composition of the human intestinal microflora to the benefit of the host. These beneficial effects may result in the suppression of harmful microorganisms, the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth, or both.** In the future, control and manipulation of the bacterial colonization in the neonatal gut may be a new approach to the prevention and treatment of intestinal infectious diseases of various etiologies.\n\nWhile it is possible that the antibiotic your son is taking can impact his gut flora, it is also important to note that breast milk contains a host of factors that can assist in re-establishing a healthy balance.", "14298": "There appear to be both genetic and environmental factors for the development of myopia.

However, the work of macrophages, enzymes and other agents of the immune system is severely restricted when hypoxia exists.\n\nFor example, [Dr. Rockwell from Yale University School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu/intranet/facultybydept/sara_rockwell-2.profile) studied malignant changes on the cellular level and wrote in an abstract, titled \u2018[Oxygen delivery: Implications for the biology and therapy of solid tumors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406244),\u2019\n\n> The physiologic effects of hypoxia and the associated microenvironmental inadequacies increase mutation rates, select for cells deficient in normal pathways of programmed cell death, and contribute to the development of an increasingly invasive, metastatic phenotype.\n\nMalignant cells normally and constantly appear and exist in any human organism due to the billions of cell divisions and mutations.

Invasiveness usually implies an ability to break loose, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels, and form secondary tumors, called\u00a0metastases, at other sites in the body.\n\n\u2018[Acute hypoxia in tumors: implications for modifiers of radiation effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3759546?dopt=Abstract),\u2019 describes methods that were developed in selecting and analyzing cells from tumors as a function of their distance from the tumor blood supply. \n\n> This information provides direct evidence that, at least for that tumor, hypoxia can result from transient fluctuations in blood perfusion.\n\nThere is evidence about the fast growth of tumors when the condition of hypoxia is present. \u2018[Microenvironmental and cellular consequences of altered blood flow in tumours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456710)\u2019 gives credence to this notion, stating\n\n> ...tumor angiogenesis is triggered by various signals characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, including low oxygen tension, low extracellular pH and low glucose concentration. \n\nThe abstract also draws a correlation between hypoxia and cancer metastasis:    \n\n> Exposure to hypoxia either induces or selects for cells that are hyper glycolytic, and this in turn produces local *acidosis* which is also a common feature of solid tumors\u2026Evidence linking tumor acidity with increased activity of several extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme systems is examined\u2026High levels of lactate, another end-product of glycolysis, in primary lesions have been correlated with increased likelihood of metastasis...adoption of a hyper glycolytic phenotype is a necessary feature of carcinogenesis itself and confers a survival and proliferative advantage to tumor cells over surrounding normal cells.

Yet, in simple organisms, mice, and humans, fasting--no calorie intake--induces a wide range of changes associated with cellular protection, which would be difficult to achieve even with a cocktail of potent drugs. In mammals, the protective effect of fasting is mediated, in part, by an over 50% reduction in glucose and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels. Because proto-oncogenes function as key negative regulators of the protective changes induced by fasting, cells expressing oncogenes, and therefore the great majority of cancer cells, should not respond to the protective signals generated by fasting, promoting the differential protection (differential stress resistance) of normal and cancer cells. Preliminary reports indicate that fasting for up to 5 days followed by a normal diet, may also protect patients against chemotherapy without causing chronic weight loss. By contrast, the long-term 20 to 40% restriction in calorie intake (dietary restriction, DR), whose effects on cancer progression have been studied extensively for decades, requires weeks-months to be effective, causes much more modest changes in glucose and/or IGF-I levels, and promotes chronic weight loss in both rodents and humans. In this study, we review the basic as well as clinical studies on fasting, cellular protection and chemotherapy resistance, and compare them to those on DR and cancer treatment. Although additional pre-clinical and clinical studies are necessary, fasting has the potential to be translated into effective clinical interventions for the protection of patients and the improvement of therapeutic index.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21516129", "5047": "The main problem you are going to run into, if you are limiting yourself to that particular [multivalent][1] vaccine formulation, is that it hasn't been on the market long enough ([2013][2]) for something specific to that 6-in-1 formulation.

Clinical trials are conducted by separating patients into at least two groups.  One control group just takes a placebo.  The test group takes the drug.  This type of study is sometimes called randomized double blind placebo control study.  This process is further described in this [paper][2].

And, they pay much attention where the Test group's side effects are much larger than for the Control group.  And, they measure whether that difference is real and not due to just randomness.  The latter (probability that occurence is just random) is captured in a probability called a p-value.  If that p-value is less than 0.05, the side effect is deemed to be statistically significant (and greater than for placebo).\n\nIn the US, the mentioned clinical trials are submitted for assessment and drug approval or denial to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).

The dose is calculated to cover that period of rest (sleep).\n\nTo understand this, you need to understand steady state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.\n\nAfter a certain number of doses, a drug builds up in the body *to a steady state* - meaning it stays more or less in the same concentration in the blood between doses, or to put it another way, the amount being taken in and the amount being eliminated by the body are about equal.\n\nIt's not guesswork; researchers study the drug before it's even released to determine such things (see the second reference.) Pharmacokinetic studies determine the dosages at which the concentration of a particular drug/antibiotic is always high enough between doses such that serum levels don't fall below effective levels.\n\nSay a drug under investigation is given every 12 hours. Blood is drawn at frequent intervals over a number of doses for to determine peak levels (the time at which the concentration in the blood is highest) and trough levels (the time when the drug is the lowest.) If at the trough level the drug is below that needed to be effective, the dosing interval decreases: the subject must take it more frequently, say every 8 hours. This cycle continues until the ideal dosage and dose interval is established. The final recommendation takes into account how long you can go without taking the drug and still have enough drug - how to take the drug such that the steady state is maintained - if you sleep.\n\nIf a drug falls below the effective dose quickly (say it is metabolized into an ineffective product), and a satisfactory prolonged serum level can't be arrived at, the prescribing physician will alert you to the fact that you *must* take it to as close to how it's prescribed as possible, and will tell you what to do if you miss a dose.\n\nWhen the timing of administration of life-saving drugs is *critical*, it's not uncommon to hospitalize a patient to assure such administration.\n\n>I have heard that the impact of medication lessens if the dosage is delayed, so how come sleep through the night without medication is okay? \n\nThat has all been calculated so that there is adequate and continuous coverage.

Further more, there is evidence that it *may* aid strengthening of the teeth as, when the bacteria lyse calcium is released into the medium. \n\nAdditionally, a study in the same agenda proves that the high caffiene content in the Robusta bean, from the Coffea canephora plant, contributes to the ability of the bean to cause an [antiadhesive effect](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11853508) in the saliva, preventing the bacteria from initially adhering to the host i.e. the tooth, and hence preventing the receptors on your tooth surface from communicating with the bacterial cells that cause decay/cavities (Streptococcus mutans). Bacterial cells have no vision, they arrive at their destination per say, by cell signalling so, interfering with the receptor sites on your teeth means that they have a loss of direction.\n\nWhen the bacteria do successfully attach to the teeth they [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling) other bacterial cells causing colonization on the enamel surface.

The SPC of Alphosyl, however, does state that it should be used for 4 weeks, and if the use is longer than that it should be supervised by a physician. So, if nobody else provides an answer, perhaps it would be best to talk to your physician about changing your routine or the treatment. It is often a matter of trial and error to determine what would work in an individual patient. ", "3166": "The medical way to ask your question is \"What are the [pharmacokinetics][1] of pyridoxine (B6 version that you're likely to take)?\"\n\nThen that brings us to both [primary][2] and [secondary][3] [sources][4], along with [a good animal model study][5].\n\n\"The greatest portion reaches the brain\" will likely be shortly after the peak serum concentration, or [Cmax][6].  The amount of time it takes for a drug to get to Cmax is Tmax.   There is going to be some variability in Tmax based on age, sex, weight, diet, and B6 formulation.  [A comparison][7] of two formulations directly found a range of 1.25 to 1.44h, which is a little tighter of the general range of 1-2 hours.\n\nI didn't find a source that showed peak concentrations in [CNS tissue][8] or that looked at the delay in B6 crossing the [blood brain barrier][9] (which it will readily given its solubility), but there is little reason to suspect that it is too delayed thereafter.  [Animal studies][5] have shown that the vast majority (80-90%) of B6 is stored in muscles and the liver, so even though the peak concentration for the CNS will follow Cmax, most of the B6 will not end up there.\n\nYour next two questions are mostly implicitly answered in the first question.  The peak and greatest portion are likely to be very close together (I couldn't find any evidence of delayed metabolism in the CNS).  But expanding on your third question a little, it gets there via the blood, which is pretty standard for most drugs/nutrients/vitamins in humans.  As far as taking it from swallowing the pill, it then continues along the digestive tract to the small intestine.  Mostly in the [jejunum][10], but somewhat in the [ileum][11] (2nd and 3rd part of small intestine) it passively diffuses into the blood, where it circulates through the heart and eventually to your brain.\n\nEating more food may prolong the time the pill is in the stomach, thereby delaying the time that the B6 is absorbed in the small intestine.  Generically this is called gastric emptying, and an approachable site on the subject can be found [here][12].  Even though I'm pretty sure this is made up data to estimate the point, I think it's worth duplicating their time graph:\n\n[![%meal in stomach vs time][13]][13]\n\nI would like to point out, that this is not something that you will be able to time on a stopwatch and fine tune.  Any of these values could easily vary by an hour.  I also want to point out that taking high doses of B6 can be habit forming, and that the [study on dreaming][14] cited in the wiki is far from convincing.  Further it was published in a relatively [low impact journal][15].  I'm not saying it isn't true, but I don't like the idea of people super dosing B6 for recreational dream use.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8598418\n  [3]: http://www.drugs.com/ppa/pyridoxine-hydrochloride-b6.html\n  [4]: http://www.robholland.com/Nursing/Drug_Guide/data/monographframes/P100.html\n  [5]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb28043.x\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmax_%28pharmacology%29\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8229700\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum\n  [12]: http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/emptying.html\n  [13]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BGyg7.gif\n  [14]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11883552#\n  [15]: http://www.researchgate.net/journal/0031-5125_Perceptual_and_Motor_Skills", "1945": "Restless Legs Syndrome (a.k.a. Willis-Ekbom Disease) is not rare! What it is is woefully under-diagnosed. Not that you asked, but, although estimates of prevalence vary widely depending on the criteria used, [5-8% of people in Europe/U.S][chest] have clinically significant RLS/WED, with women affected about twice as often as men. \n\nNow to what you did ask: treatment of RLS/WED. In most situations, there is no *curative* treatment. However, there are excellent (mostly pharmacologic) treatments available to suppress symptoms. A few words about the various treatments by class:\n\n1. **Iron.** For reasons that are not fully understood, even sub-clinical (i.e. otherwise non-problematic) iron deficiency is associated with an increased prevalence of RLS/WED, and [treatment with iron has been repeatedly shown to be helpful in that population][iron]. Recommendations vary, but most people would agree that iron supplementation should be provided to raise ferritin >20 \u03bcg/L, with some advocating cut-offs as high as 50 \u03bcg/L. Transferrin saturation should also be > 16% - 20%. Occasionally, RLS symptoms completely resolve with treatment of iron deficiency.\n\n2. **Dopaminergic agents.** L-dopa (the therapeutic ingredient in Sinemet) has long been known to be effective treatment for RLS/WED. Unfortunately, it tends to promote [\u201caugmentation\u201d][wgb], where the drug ends up causing an iatrogenic worsening of symptoms over time, [necessitating a change in treatment][sm] The newer dopamine agonists - pramipexole and ropinirole - have a lower (although still existent and commonly problematic during long-term treatment) incidence of augmentation. These are the medications most people start with for treating RLS. Nearly all patients who are correctly diagnosed will have at least partial improvement in RLS/WED symptoms with introduction of dopamine agonists. \n[jww]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521108\n[wgb]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24978636\n[sm]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045290\n3. **Alpha-2-delta agents**. This is a class of anti-epileptic drugs that has been increasingly used for treatment of RLS in recent years. The advantage of these drugs over dopaminergic agents is mostly that they are much less likely to cause augmentation. (Some would say that augmentation is *exclusively* a dopaminergic phenomenon, but this is debated.) The most commonly used drugs in the U.S. in this category are gabapentin and pregabalin. A [landmark study in 2014][jww] published in the New England Journal indicated that pregabalin is at least as effective as pramipexole, with a much lower incidence of augmentation. These drugs may become first-line agents in the future.\n\n4. **Opiods**. You mentioned a family member on methadone for RLS/WED. This medication in particular [is remarkably effective for RLS][ms]. There was also a [recent study demonstrating the efficacy of oxycodone][ct]. Opioids have many side effects for long term usage (some of the more problematic: respiratory depression, potential for overdose, abuse potential, constipation). However, particularly for patients who have been suffering from RLS for many years and experienced augmentation with dopaminergic agents, opioids are at times appropriate and generally provide substantial relief. \n\nPlease see [the most recent practice parameters from the American Association of Sleep Medicine][aasm] and [a recent meta-analysis of treatment options][jama] for further information. \n\n\n[aasm]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851801\n[ct]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140442\n[ms]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239226\n[chest]: http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1084803\n[iron]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441748\n[jama]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23460396\n", "1815": "So far daily caffeine intake has not proven to be too dangerous.

They will determine if your hearing loss is due to a chronic perforation (one that has not healed itself), or middle-ear bone damage (or another possible cause) which occurred during the traumatic event. In most cases, there are surgical treatments. If the perforation is still present, a simple patch may be all that's needed. If a bone was injured, the surgery (bone repair or replacement) is more involved. Other injuries are treated dependent on case.\n\nEdited to add: During healing, care should be taken to keep water out of the ear (no swimming; baths or showers with protection from water in ear), and, though I have not seen a study on it, I would recommend against headphones except at a very low volume.

Vegetarian diets are related to lower **blood pressure** (7,8), lower **body weight** and **Body Mass Index** (BMI) (3,9), lower serum levels of **total and LDL cholesterol** (3) (LDL is \"the bad one\"), lower levels of C-reactive protein (10) (= show a lower lever of chronical inflammation), and higher **insulin sensitivity** (11) (this means they're less prone to diabetes).

But nonetheless, they produce measurable adverse effects on your glucose homeostasis, the pathways of which are still not quite clear but may - amongst others - have to do with your gut flora, your insulin receptor sensitivity or behaviourial mechanisms of the brain reacting to sweet taste.", "1031": "Insulin resistance and obesity are both symptoms of type 2 diabetes, although they also occur at a prediabetic stage, before the diabetes diagnostic criteria are met. [Insulin resistance is highly predictive of diabetes][1]. In the [Bruneck study][2], less than 10% of the insulin resistant subjects had no other metabolic disorder. But still, the exact relationship between insulin resistance and obesity is unclear, as they could\n\n- have a common cause, or \n- one of them causes the other, or \n- be coupled in a positive feedback cycle, or\n- all of the above. But we know that they are highly correlated in untreated patients. \n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\nThis is the prevalence of insulin resistance in adolescents from [NHANES][4], with white circles denoting normal weight adolescents, black squares denoting overweight adolescents and black circles denoting obese adolescents. \n\nFor example, [one of the theories][5] for the progression to diabetes is that the capacity of the body's usual fat depots is overtaxed, leading to having too much fat where it does not belong (e.g. intraabdominal fat deposits), resulting in lipotoxicity and finally diabetes. This would be a potential argument for obesity leading to insulin resistance. A common cause could be searched e.g. in [reduced incretin secretion][6] or [increased JNK activity][7]. But given the difficulty of finding a clear mechanism, and the complexity of the pathways involved, the connection is probably multifactorial.  \n\nWeight loss is one of the goals in diabetes management. Exercise and dieting delay the progression of prediabetic stages to diabetes. They reduce both obesity and insulin resistance. So, to answer your question directly, **if you had insulin resistance, and you managed to lose weight, it is very likely that your insulin sensitivity has increased.** \n\nThe above assumes that the patient is not taking any metabolic treatment. If he is taking diabetes medications, their effect on insulin sensitivity and weight will be independent. Some medication classes like [GLP 1 agonists][8] will reduce both obesity and insulin related effects, as will [bariatric surgery][9]. [Metformin][10] will improve insulin sensitivity without affecting weight much, while [the glitazones][11] reduce insulin resistance but lead to weight gain. \n\n\n  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369292814V\n  [2]: http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giovanni_Targher/publication/13533291_Prevalence_of_insulin_resistance_in_metabolic_disorders_the_Bruneck_Study/links/00b4951dd5f59ca7d2000000.pdf\n  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/JxrsV.gif\n  [4]: http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/11/2427.full#F1\n  [5]: https://class.coursera.org/diabetes-003/\n  [6]: http://www.diapedia.org/metabolism/glp-1-defects-in-diabetes\n  [7]: http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lufen_Chang/publication/11022576_A_central_role_for_JNK_in_obesity_and_insulin_resistance/links/5481cee20cf2941f830a02bd.pdf\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952301\n  [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery\n  [10]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin\n  [11]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedione", "1026": "In healthy patients, a circadianic rhythm of urine excretion [has been observed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17335055).

Most seizures are brief, resolving spontaneously within 1-2 minutes.<sup>1</sup> These are rarely fatal. On the other hand, *status epilepticus* is not infrequently associated with death. *Status epilepticus* (sometime referred to in shorthand as just *status*) just means a prolonged seizure lasting at least 30 minutes. It can also refer to a situation that is technically multiple seizures back-to-back, but without complete return to baseline in between. [A recent review of *status epilepticus* quoted the statistic][jb2]: \n\n> The overall mortality associated with status epilepticus approaches 20%, with generalised convulsive status epilepticus representing about 45\u201374% of all cases.\n\n\nHowever, it has long been recognized that it is very difficult to know whether the seizure itself or the factor that provoked the seizure is actually responsible for death.<sup>2</sup> The strongest predictor of death from *status* is the underlying cause. For instance, in *status* attributable to hypoxia, death occurs over 50% of the time.<sup>1</sup> That is because a seizure is likely to be provoked only by a pretty dire state of hypoxia &mdash; either not responsive to maximal interventions or occurring in a setting where such interventions are not available or not desired.\n\nTo the extent that death is directly attributable to the seizure, it is generally because of what doctors often refer has \u201cinability to protect the airway.\u201d Normal, conscious people have reflexes that \u201cprotect\u201d the airway at the level of the oropharynx to prevent aspiration.

So cause of it should be always determine by a doctor (ophthalmologist). Abnormal eye floaters are associated with bleeding in the vitreous from diabetic retinopathy, retinal tears, retinal detachment or large degrees of nearsightedness. If floaters are accompanied by flashes of light or a loss of side vision, seek medical advice immediately.\n\nMost eye floaters decrease/reduce in size on their own due to absorption through the natural processes within the eye.

It removes the actual vitreous from the eye, eliminating the eye floaters in the process, but it also increase risk of retinal detachment or cataract, so surgery should only be used as a treatment for eye floaters in extreme cases.

More tests are needed to investigate the efficacy of bilberry in treating floaters.\n\n\nNutrients which are important in managing eye floaters according to [NaturalEyeCare][7]:\n\n- Hyaluronic acid\n\n > Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan) is a large molecule found in the vitreous gel which it is believed contributes to its gel-like quality and may also support related connective tissue. Elsewhere in the body it is found in the gel-like fluid that lubricates joints and it is a component of the tissue healing process. As we age, the amount of hyaluronan in the body decreases.\n\n > Hyaluronic acid has been shown to be effective in helping eyes heal after cataract surgery. ([source][8])\n\n- Glucosame sulfate\n\n > Glucosamine sulfate helps maintain connective tissue integrity. Some floaters are caused by disintegration of the lining of the vitreous sac. This nutrient may help slow down the natural aging effect on a weakening vitreous. Many people have noted an increase in floaters when they have joint disorders which may be related to chronic, systemic inflammation and its effect on eye health.\n\n- Vitamin C\n\n > Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for overall eye health. Since floaters are often the result of vitreous tears/detachments and/or clumping of the vitreous due to aging, vitamin C plays a role in blood and lymph circulation, waste elimination and supporting connective tissue. It may play a role in supporting the body in breaking down eye floaters. Learn more about the role of vitamin C in the body.\n\n- L-methionine\n\n > This amino acid can assist in removal of heavy metals and toxins that can contribute to eye disease. Methionine has a role in the body's synthesis of cysteine and taurine, two other important amino acids for vision health.\n\n- Inositol\n\n > The carbohydrate inositol plays a role in moderating levels of calcium in the cell membrane and within each cell, which in turn plays a role in protecting the vitreous.\n\n- Calcium \n\n > Calcium supports healthy connective tissue of the eye and throughout the body. Researchers have found that low levels of calcium (in proportion to phosphorus) is tied to increases in floaters.\n\n- Zinc, Copper & Chromium\n\n > Zinc has some antioxidant characteristics. It plays a major role in bringing Vitamin A from the liver to the retina and helps Vitamin A create a protective pigment called melanin. Zinc also helps support the health of tiny capillaries in the eye, which are essential in nourishing the retina and related connective tissue. Zinc and copper, in balance, help support a proper acid balance in the body, which in turn helps may help avoid development of new floaters. Chromium may help limit nearsightedness, a risk factor for eye floaters. Chromium also has a role in sugar balance in the body.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nSee also:\n\n - [Eye Floaters][9] at Medicine Net\n - [Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)][10]\n - [Pars plana vitrectomy for persistent, visually significant vitreous opacities.][12] (study)\n\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy\n  [2]: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-30/health/sc-health-0530-eyesight-supplements-20120530_1_age-related-eye-disease-study-antioxidant-vitamins-beta-carotene-and-zinc\n  [3]: http://www.natural-remedies-review.com/msm.html\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10385132\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8732492\n  [6]: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/202.html\n  [7]: http://www.naturaleyecare.com/eye-conditions/eye-floaters/\n  [8]: http://www.natural-remedies-review.com/msm.html\n  [9]: http://www.medicinenet.com/eye_floaters/article.htm\n  [10]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_vitreous_detachment\n  [11]: http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Floaters\n  [12]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11131410", "23282": "Regarding calcium transport in the kidney:\n\n> In contrast with the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of\n> the loop of Henle, the distal tubule reabsorbs calcium exclusively via\n> the transcellular route.\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2XNY.png\n\n\nSee also: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4491294/\n\nAlso, calcium availability in blood (and hence for filtration in the kidney) is dependent on pH - higher pH will increase binding of calcium to albumine (this is happens e. g.  in plasmapheresis when EDTA is added to your blood to prevent coagulation outside of your body); see also: https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)57007-5/pdf\n\n> In the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and connecting tubule (CNT),\n> acidosis effects the expression of TRPV5, but also the luminal H+\n> concentration has direct effects on TRPV5 activity (H+ inhibits). \n> \n> Consequently, bicarbonaturia, by increasing luminal pH increases TRPV5\n> activity.

Admixture among archaic groups and between them and modern humans seems to have occurred whenever they came into geographic proximity. In that way, they were no different from groups of modern humans. Although most present-day human ancestry can be traced to African populations that dispersed into Eurasia \u223c100,000 y ago, aDNA has allowed us to also determine which parts of our genomes are from archaic hominins that occupied Eurasia before modern humans (68): all non-African genomes carry small amounts of Neanderthal ancestry, and some carry an additional component of Denisovan ancestry.\n\nSo, the question is whether Neanderthal/Denisovan genes help protect against viral diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThere are some hints that this might be the case in European populations:\n\n> Humans differ in the outcome that follows exposure to life-threatening pathogens, yet the extent of population differences in immune responses and their genetic and evolutionary determinants remain undefined. Here, we characterized, using RNA sequencing, the transcriptional response of primary monocytes from Africans and Europeans to bacterial and viral stimuli\u2014ligands activating Toll-like receptor pathways (TLR1/2, TLR4, and TLR7/8) and influenza virus\u2014and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identify numerous cis-eQTLs that contribute to the marked differences in immune responses detected within and between populations and a strong trans-eQTL hotspot at TLR1 that decreases expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Europeans only. We find that immune-responsive regulatory variants are enriched in population-specific signals of natural selection and show that admixture with Neandertals introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting preferentially responses to viral challenges. Together, our study uncovers evolutionarily important determinants of differences in host immune responsiveness between human populations.\n\nand \n\n> Genetic variation transmitted through admixture with Neandertals can also represent a source of functional, potentially advantageous variants (Vattathil and Akey, 2015). Relative to genome-wide expectations, we show that genetic segments introgressed from Neandertals have preferentially introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting steady-state expression and responses to TLR7/8 stimulation and IAV. Furthermore, we report several loci presenting strong evidence of archaic ancestry that exert a regulatory effect in cis. Among these, we find the IAV-induced reQTL of PNMA1, which encodes a protein that physically interacts with the IAV protein PB2 and stimulates interferon production (Shapira et al., 2009). That the PNMA1 haplotype presents a frequency in Europeans that is not compatible with neutral evolution, together with its strong levels of population differentiation between modern Europeans and East Asians, supports its contribution to European adaptation and provides a case of adaptive introgression. The functional roles of the introgressed regulatory variants require further investigation, but our results clearly establish that archaic admixture, whether adaptive or not, has increased the diversity of the immune repertoire of contemporary Europeans.\n\nSo, it appears that the introduction of Neaderthal genes that influence immune responses has lead to an increased range of possible responses to viral infection than was possible from pure African genomes.\n\nGenetic Adaptation and Neandertal Admixture Shaped the Immune System of Human Populations\nhttps://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2816%2931306-X\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988579/", "23173": "An article in National Geographic summarizes several theories on why COVID-19 is less lethal in children (but not infants): https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/03/coronavirus-spares-most-kids-these-theories-may-help-explain-why/\n\nThey cite Ming S. Yip et al. (2011), which implicates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) triggered by prior infections of other endemic coronaviruses (common colds). Ming suggests that because adults have more past exposure to priming strains of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 is able to enter human immune cells through an antibody-mediated pathway. See:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019510/\n\nMore recently, Jason A. Tetro (2020) suggests geographic differences in COVID-19 mortality further support the theory that ADE contributes to symptom severity and risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Real reasons will probably remain a mystery fortunately because the number of infected [by which they probably mean tested] children is too low to allow good-sized immunological studies.\n\nBy \"trained immunity\" they mostly seem to mean cross-reactivity to other vaccines administered in childhood. (They do mention NK cells as playing a role in that; see also in-depth [*Science* article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087274/) on this fairly rencent notion of \"trained immunity\" aka \"innate immune memory\".)\n\nFrankly their last argument (high lymphocyte count) seems a bit in doubt because a [CDC study (April 10)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm) found that infants <1yo actually might \"get it worse\" than the 1-17 y.o. group:\n\n> Children aged <1 year accounted for the highest percentage (15%\u201362%) of hospitalization among pediatric patients with COVID-19. Among 95 children aged <1 year with known hospitalization status, 59 (62%) were hospitalized, including five who were admitted to an ICU. The percentage of patients hospitalized among those aged 1\u201317 years was lower (estimated range = 4.1%\u201314%), with little variation among age groups.\n\nSo it's not an entirely uniform effect (by age).\n\nAlso from the CDC study, another mystery is why male children seem to get it (somewhat) more often:\n\n> In this preliminary analysis of U.S. pediatric COVID-19 cases, a majority (57%) of patients were males. Several studies have reported a majority of COVID-19 cases among males (4,9), and an analysis of 44,000 COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages in China reported a higher case-fatality rate among men than among women (10). However, the same report, as well as a separate analysis of 2,143 pediatric COVID-19 cases from China, detected no substantial difference in the number of cases among males and females (5,10). Reasons for any potential difference in COVID-19 incidence or severity between males and females are unknown. In the present analysis, the predominance of males in all pediatric age groups, including patients aged <1 year, suggests that biologic factors might play a role in any differences in COVID-19 susceptibility by sex.\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/TagHI.png", "21660": "TL;DR: please WEAR A MASK! \n--\n\n(unless your nearby hospitals are out of it, in which case give your masks  to them and stay at home)\n\n---\n\nThe link you mentioned provides the reason that the CDC likely has in mind (though I agree it doesn't identify it clearly as the reason):\n\n> The worldwide supply of masks is limited.

Perhaps this risk should be considered when choosing the optimal treatment technique and delivery system for patients who will undergo prostate radiation.\n\nHere, IMRT was shown to deliver a higher \"out-of-field\" dose (raditation  to untargeted parts of the body) and had a greater associated risk of secondary malignancies than conventional radiation.\n\n>[**\"Risk of Developing Second Cancer From Neutron Dose in Proton Therapy as Function of Field Characteristics, Organ, and Patient Age.\" Jarlskog *et al.* *International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics. 2008.***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301608008158)\n>\n> Results: The main contributors (>80%) to the neutron-induced risk are neutrons generated in the treatment head. Treatment volume can influence the risk by up to a factor of \u223c2. Young patients are subject to significantly greater risks than are adult patients because of the geometric differences and age dependency of the risk models. Breast cancer should be the main concern for females. For males, the risks of lung cancer, leukemia, and thyroid cancer were significant for pediatric patients. In contrast, leukemia was the leading risk for an adult. Most lifetime risks were <1% (70-Gy treatment). The only exceptions were breast, thyroid, and lung cancer for females. For female thyroid cancer, treatment risk can exceed baseline risk.\n>\n> Conclusion: The risk of developing a second malignancy from neutrons from proton beam therapy of a brain lesion is small (i.e., presumably outweighed by the therapeutic benefit) but not negligible (i.e., potentially greater than the baseline risk). The patient's age at treatment plays a major role.\n\nLike the IMRT, neutron bombardment from proton therapy was shown to have off-target effects and contribute to new cancers. \n\nHopefully, these papers serve as decent representations of different secondary malignancy potentials with respect to primary cancer therapies. In the article [\"Understanding Your Risk of Developing Secondary Cancers,\"](https://www.nccn.org/patients/resources/life_after_cancer/understanding.aspx) the National Comprehensive Cancer Network reminds readers to prioritize their care without regard to comparatively low-probability secondary malignancies:\n\n\n> ...patients should not cause themselves undue worry about this possibility. \"The biggest risk to patients with cancer is the cancer that they are battling. They should follow the treatment plan designed by their oncologist and not worry about other factors. The vast majority of patients are not going to develop a secondary malignancy because of cancer treatment for the original cancer.\"\n\nFinally, some medical imaging techniques are similar to those cancer therapies that are more likely to cause secondary malignancies. The [BEIR VII report \"Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation\"](http://www.philrutherford.com/Radiation_Risk/BEIR/BEIR_VII.pdf) includes risk estimates for different imaging and radiology techinques (although [some academic debate exists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1120179717302338) on whether it's an appropriate estimation tool for this, the table below uses data from BEIR VII).

Concrete is basically a mixture of aggregates and paste. The aggregates are sand and gravel or crushed stone; the paste is water and portland cement. Concrete gets stronger as it gets older. Portland cement is not a brand name, but the generic term for the type of cement used in virtually all concrete, just as stainless is a type of steel and sterling a type of silver. Cement comprises from 10 to 15 percent of the concrete mix, by volume. Through a process called hydration, the cement and water harden and bind the aggregates into a rocklike mass. This hardening process continues for years meaning that concrete gets stronger as it gets older.\n\nOne of the key ingredients in [cement][1] is lime, or [Calcium oxide][2] which may react to Calcium hydroxide, both substances or alkaline and caustic. \n\nOccupational safety precaution say this:\n>[**Appendix D Lime Safety Precautions**][3] \n\n>Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide), like most materials or chemicals in common use, is not dangerous to work with providing a few simple precautions are exercised. Quicklime (calcium oxide), also called \u201chot\u201d lime, is considerably more dangerous to use than hydrated lime. While both types of lime are strongly alkaline, quicklime is much more caustic and can produce severe burns quickly when in contact with moist skin. It is also desirable to prevent as much hydrate as possible from coming into contact with workers\u2019 skin. Usually danger from severe burns is remote, but prolonged contact of hydrated lime with a perspiring workers\u2019 skin where the skin is also chafed by tight clothing has produced bad burns. Other persons with particularly sensitive skin have developed forms of skin irritation (dermatitis) through prolonged contact. There is no urgency in removing hydrated lime from skin, but it should be flushed off with water as soon as convenient. However, quicklime should be washed off or at least brushed off immediately after contact with skin, since it is caustic. Hot, humid weather conditions tend to heighten the caustic effect of hydrated lime on a worker\u2019s skin.     \n**After Work**     \nBathe or shower after a workday to cleanse the body entirely of lime and protective cream.   \n**First Aid**     \n1. Skin burns--Wash thoroughly with soap and warm water to remove all lime. Apply a standard burn ointment used for heat or caustic burns, and cover with sterile bandages. Keep bandaged during healing to prevent infection.   \n2. Lime in the Eyes--Hold worker\u2019s eye open and flush out with water immediately. Too much water cannot be used.   \n3. Report all burns from lime or cases of lime in eyes immediately so that medical attention can be provided without delay.\n\n\n\nBut these are not all the possible causes. \n> **Construction Safety Association of Ontario: [Cement Hazards and Controls Health Risks and Precautions in Using Portland Cement][4]**\n\n> **Health effects**\n>Cement can cause ill health by skin contact, eye contact, or inhalation. Risk of injury depends on duration and level of exposure and individual sensitivity.\n\n> Hazardous materials in wet concrete and mortar include:\n\n> - alkaline compounds such as lime (calcium oxide) that are corrosive to human tissue\n- trace amounts of crystalline silica which is abrasive to the skin and can damage lungs\n- trace amounts of chromium that can cause allergic reactions.\nSkin contact\n- The hazards of wet cement are due to its caustic, abrasive, and drying properties.\n\n> Wet concrete contacting the skin for a short period and then thoroughly washed off causes little irritation. But continuous contact between skin and wet concrete allows alkaline compounds to penetrate and burn the skin.\n\n>When wet concrete or mortar is trapped against the skin\u2014for instance, by falling inside a worker\u2019s boots or gloves or by soaking through protective clothing\u2014the result may be first, second, or third degree burns or skin ulcers. These injuries can take several months to heal and may involve hospitalization and skin grafts.\n\n> **Personal protection**   \nTo protect skin from cement and cement mixtures, workers should wear:\n\n> - alkali-resistant gloves\n- coveralls with long sleeves and full-length trousers (pull sleeves down - over gloves and tuck pants inside boots and duct-tape at the top to keep mortar and concrete out)\n- waterproof boots high enough to prevent concrete from flowing in when  workers must stand in fresh concrete\n- suitable respiratory protective equipment such as a P, N or R 95  respirator when cement dust can\u2019t be avoided\n- suitable eye protection where mixing, pouring, or other activities may endanger eyes (minimum\u2014safety glasses with sideshields or goggles, under extremely dusty conditions, tight-fitting unvented or indirectly vented goggles. Don\u2019t wear contact lenses when handling cement or cement products).\n\n> **Work practices**    \nWhen laying concrete block, have different sizes on hand to avoid cutting or hammering to make them fit.\n\n> - Work in ways that minimize the amount of cement dust released.\n- Where possible, wet-cut rather than dry-cut masonry products.\n- Mix dry cement in well-ventilated areas.\n- Make sure to work upwind from dust sources.\n- Where possible, use ready-mixed concrete instead of mixing on site.\n- When kneeling on fresh concrete, use a dry board or waterproof kneepads to protect knees from water that can soak through fabric.\n- Remove jewelry such as rings and watches because wet cement can collect under them.\n\n> **Hygiene**\n\n>- Clothing contaminated by wet cement should be quickly removed. Skin in contact with wet cement should be washed immediately with \nlarge amounts of cool clean water.\n- Don\u2019t wash your hands with water from buckets used for cleaning tools.\n- Provide adequate hygiene facilities on site for workers to wash hands and face at the end of a job and before eating, drinking, smoking, or using the toilet. Facilities for cleaning boots and changing clothes should also be available.\n\n> **First aid**    \nSkin contaminated with wet or dry cement should be washed with cold running water as soon as possible. Open sores or cuts should be thoroughly flushed and covered with suitable dressings. Get medical attention if discomfort persists. Contaminated eyes should be washed with cold tap water for at least 15 minutes before the affected person is taken to hospital.\n\nThe above is what makes nearly every form of cement problematic. A less generalised source of a multitude of problems is the variable nature of other ingredients:\n> Besides portland cement, concrete may contain other cementitious materials including fly ash, a waste byproduct from coal burning electric power plants; ground slag, a byproduct of iron and steel manufacturing; and silica fume, a waste byproduct from the manufacture of silicon or ferro-silicon metal. Some of these cementitious materials are similar to the volcanic ashes the Romans mixed with lime to obtain their cement binder.\n\nAlthough these other ingredients should be chosen carefully by the manufacturer, the list of possible substances is quite long. Things like toxicity or allergenic potential are impossible to predict for that from general considerations. Some cement mixtures contain quite a lot of [hexavalent chromium][5] for example.\n\nThe most likely cause remains the alkaline nature of cement. Symptoms for the occupational safety hazard might look like:\n> [![enter image description here][6]][7]\n> [![enter image description here][8]][9]\n\n\nBut\n> **[These Problems Aren't Set in Stone][10]**   \nConcrete burns are a serious, sometimes disabling problem for exposed workers. Medical tests cannot predict who will get skin problems.\n\nThere are even cases of [second hand cement exposure][11].\n\nFrom all of this it should be clear to practice good occupational safety, to use protective gear and consult a medical practitioner as soon as any suspicious symptoms appear.\n\n\nFor a recent review of potentially problematic ingredients, see:\n> [Rawaz Kurda & Jos\u00e9 D. Silvestre & Jorge de Brito: \"Toxicity and environmental and economic performance of fly ash and recycled concrete aggregates use in concrete: A review\", Heliyon, 4(4) 2018][12], DOI:[10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00611][13]    \n> A study on the potential metal leaching and toxicity of FA, when used as binder in soil stabilization, showed significant differences in leaching characteristics with respect to heavy metals. [\u2026] \n> Numerous toxic elements show high enrichment in the fine particles of coal FA [66]. In fact, the concentration of volatile elements, such as, Cd, Pb and Zn, increases with the decrease of FA particle size from coarse to fine [67, 68]. Moreover, the particles of FA have a large surface area in comparison to mass [69]. The smaller particles have higher surface areas and contain significant surface concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements [70]. According to Roy et al. [71], the leachability of elements (P, Fe, Al, B, K, and Ca) decreases for longer ages. The authors also sorted the relative concentrations of leached elements in 3 pH levels: (I) Alkaline: Se > B > Cr > Ni> Cu > Ba > As > Zn > Al; (II) Neutral: B > Cd > As > Se > Zn > Ni > Mn > Cu >Ba; and (III) Acidic: B \u226b Zn > Ca, F > Na > Mg, Co > Ni, Sr > Be > Cu, Pb, Al \u226b Si, Fe, K.\nBased on a study by Theis and Gardner, the aqueous solubility of FA ranges is about 0.5\u20133% of total original mass. In spite of the insignificant total amount of leachate, the content needs to be precisely investigated and compared to the corresponding regulations.[\u2026]\n\n> - It has been argued that FA concrete showed considerable leaching of heavy metals and must be regarded as hazardous materials while other studies show that heavy metal's concentrations in leachates from concrete containing FA are significantly lower and very close to the EPA drinking water standard limit;\n- Long-term leaching from well-cured concrete produced with OPC and neither RCA nor NA release detectable concentrations of toxic metals;\n- The leaching metals of FA decrease when they are incorporated in concrete. This reduction of the heavy metals' leaching between the FA powder and FA concrete may be related to the cement's ability to solubilize/stabilize the concentration of heavy metals due to chemical retention processes that allow the incorporation of the elements in the cement matrix, and physical retention by encapsulation. However, this study still suggests avoiding the use of FA concrete for drinking water tank and architectural concrete applications.\n\nThat means that concrete may contain quite a bit of problematic substances. Which substances anyone working with these cannot be predicted by just talking about \"concrete\". The actual mixture in use has to be analysed.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxide\n  [3]: http://www.virginiadot.org/business/resources/Materials/MCS_Study_Guides/bu-mat-AppendDAP.pdf\n  [4]: http://elcosh.org/document/1563/d000513/cement-hazards-and-controls-health-risks-and-precautions-in-using-portland-cement.html\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexavalent_chromium\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Wg0rs.png\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Wg0r.png\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItgyWs.png\n  [9]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItgyW.png\n  [10]: https://ohsonline.com/articles/2007/03/these-problems-arent-set-in-stone.aspx\n  [11]: http://elcosh.org/document/60/d000458/a-safety-%26-health-practitioners-guide-to-skin-protection.html#2\n  [12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968176/\n  [13]: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.heliyon.2018.e00611", "16787": "Exercise does seem to have beneficial effects in treating and preventing many chronic diseases. As far as mechanism is concerned, we should probably narrow the scope:\n\nQuestion:\n>What is the mechanism for the beneficial effects of exercise in people who have high blood pressure?\n\nIt seems to be multifactorial, and independent of any impact on weight loss. Regular exercises (with or without associated weight loss) causes a number of physiologic adaptations in metabolic, vascular, and cardiac health, all of which seem to contribute to the beneficial effects for people with high blood pressure (lower blood pressure, better long term disease outcomes). There are, of course, many types of exercise and many causes of high blood pressure, but these seem to apply generally.\n\n1. Changes in sympathetic/parasympathetic tone: regular exercise causes decreased catecholamine production and (associated) decreased sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction. This leads directly to lower blood pressure because of the decrease in systemic vascular resistance\n\n2. Increased perfusion and development of muscular capillary beds. Increased perfusion of muscular beds may be the primary mechanism for the acute decrease in blood pressure. With regular exercise, angiogenesis causes further development of muscular capillary beds as well. The opening of arterioles to perfuse these (now more developed) capillary beds also decreases systemic vascular resistance (and along with it, blood pressure).  \n\n3. Improved insulin sensitivity: insulin sensitivity is compromised in many people with high blood pressure, whether or not they have frank diabetes. The reduction in circulating insulin improves clearance of lipids and glucose from the blood, and theoretically reduces the downstream negative effects of high circulating lipids and glucose, including atherosclerosis. This has a direct effect on hypertension as well as the downstream negative effects of hypertension.\n\n4. Decreased inflammation: regular exercise reduces circulating levels of inflammatory mediators, improving endothelial function (and decreasing atherosclerosis). This also has a direct effect on hypertension as well as its sequelae. \n\n5. Improved cardiac function: regular exercise improves diastolic filling (directly, through beneficial adaptations in cardiac muscle, and, probably, indirectly, through the above effects on systemic vascular resistance, atherosclerosis, and endothelial function). \n\nAn excellent broad ranging review of the health benefits of physical activity discusses these benefits. You can find it for free [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/)\n\nA more recent review by the same first author is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28708630), but it is behind a paywall.\n", "16707": "CRISPR/Cas9 is the great white hope of genetic medicine with huge potential.  However, this is a field in which progress has been famously slow because of high difficulties in translating promising pre-clinical therapeutic strategies to effective treatments in humans.\n\nIn broad strokes, the answer is going to be \"when CRISPR based therapies are ready for other conditions\".  The biggest barriers to getting CRISPR based therapeutics into the clinic will be:\n\n1. Safety - can we be sure that the changes we intend are made cleanly and without off-target effects?\n2. Delivery - how do we get the CRISPR construct into the cells it needs to be in to work?\n3. Efficacy - can we effect a change in sufficient cells to produce a clinical response?\n\nAs pointed out in the comments, there are still significant safety concerns about off-target effects. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0050-6 reports significant toxicity with efficient recombination. \n Furthermore, there is an emerging body of evidence that there are pre-existing CRISPR/Cas9 immune responses which may cause clinical \n side-effects and/or limit efficiency of recombination (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/05/243345.full.pdf).\n\nDelivery of the construct may well be the most difficult aspect of therapy.  There are diseases which can be treated with exogenous cells, for example T cells cells modified with CRISPR techniques and re-infused as in:\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-tested-in-a-person-for-the-first-time-1.20988\nhttps://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02793856?term=crispr\n\nHowever, what if the target is present in somatic tissues such as APOE4 (which is what I assume you mean instead of APOA4) such as the liver?  How do we effectively get the CRISPR/Cas9 construct into these cells in a non-toxic, efficient and targeted manner?\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779917303049?via%3Dihub provides a nice review of current delivery methods but concludes that one of the current outstanding questions is \"Are any of the currently available delivery methods reliable enough for therapeutic use of Cas9 genome editing in humans?\".\n\nFinally, efficacy.  For some diseases, such as sickle cell anaemia, it is thought that as little as a 10% conversion from the disease form of HbS to wild-type HbA would be sufficient for clinical improvement.  For APOE4 however there is still a significant (~4x) risk for developing Alzheimer's disease over baseline in heterozygotes compared to a ~12x risk over baseline for homozygotes (https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-8-9).  To achieve a reduction in risk to baseline would therefore likely require significantly more than 50% recombination rate.  Furthermore, for an effect to be longstanding and, ideally, lifelong the stem cells which give rise to e.g. liver parenchyma would have to be altered.\n\nOverall, CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology which has revolutionised biomedical science in the laboratory already.  It seems certain that some form of CRISPR/Cas9 based therapies will be used clinically within the next ten years, however there are huge technical, safety and ethical barriers before it is a widely available treatment for a range of conditions.", "14978": "The latest systematic review in this issue found: \nthere is only weak, very low quality and unreliable evidence avalaible\nfor floss the magnitude of the effect was small, for woodsticks and oral irrigators was weak and for interdental brushes was large\n\nMain conclusions are: \n\n> There is weak evidence that flossing plus toothbrushing compared to\n> toothbrushing alone has a small but significant effect on gingivitis.\n> However, there is a lack of evidence for a concomitant reduction in\n> plaque scores. \n>\n> The evidence for woodsticks and toothbrushing as\n> compared to toothbrushing alone was weak and showed that there is a\n> benefit of unclear magnitude with respect to bleeding scores but\n> lacking evidence for a concomitant reduction of plaque. \n>\n> Moderate evidence was available for the efficacy of interdental brushes  in addition to toothbrushing as compared with toothbrushing alone.

This can be further \"enhanced\" by adding tobacco, lime or any number of flavour or extraction amplifiers. \n\nThe main psychoactive ingredient of this preparation \u2013 of only betel nut and betel pepper leaf \u2013 then comes from the alkaloids found in the betel nut.\n\nThe strongest effects are found in the alkaloid [arecoline][5].

But arecoline is different in its actions compared to nicotine:\n\n> Arecoline is the primary active ingredient responsible for the central nervous system effects of the areca nut. Arecoline has been compared to nicotine; however, nicotine acts primarily on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Arecoline is known to be a partial agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, M3 receptors and M4, which is believed to be the primary cause of its parasympathetic effects (such as pupillary constriction, bronchial constriction, etc.). \n\nThat means when used as a stimulant this combination is lends its spectrum of effects less to tobacco smoke but a bit more to the fly agaric side, while ebing substance wise very similar to nicotine in its addictiveness.\n\nUsing this stimulant habitually is indeed not advised. Not even advocates of \"natural remedies\" find much use for this:\n\n> Betel nut has been suggested as a treatment for many conditions. However, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of betel nut for any medical condition. Although betel nut is chewed recreationally, chewing or ingesting betel nut may cause many serious adverse effects, including cancer, effects on the heart and death. Betel nut should be avoided in pregnant or breast-feeding women and in children. Consult a health care professional immediately if you have any side effects.     \n<sub> [Intellihealth, (Natural Standard and Harvard Medical School: Betel Nut (Areca catechu)][7]\n</sub>\n\n\nThe leaf of the betel pepper has some effects on its own:\n> The medicinal components are primarily associated with the nut and betel quid. The nuts contain at least 9 structurally related pyridine alkaloids, including arecoline, arecaidine, arecaine, arecolidine, guvacine, isoguvacine, guvacoline, and coniine. However, the most common is the parasympathetic stimulant alkaloid arecoline. The total alkaloid content can reach 0.45%.   \nThe methyl esters of arecoline and guvacoline are hydrolyzed in the presence of alkali to the respective acids, arecaidine and guvacine. The hydrolysis is catalyzed by lime, which is added to the quid. Arecoline most likely is present in the nut as a salt of tannic acid, and the lime facilitates the release of the base from the salt.   \nComponents of the betel quid, most likely from P. betel and not betel nuts, contain about 1% of a volatile oil, chalbetol, chavicol, cadinene, allylpyrocatechol, and safrole. \n\n> **CNS Effects**\n**Clinical data**    \nStudies evaluating the effects of betel nut chewing suggest that a variety of the chemical compounds found in areca may exert activity. Arecoline demonstrates parasympathomimetic action on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors; arecaidine and guvacine act as gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake inhibitors, while phenolic compounds in the leaf stimulate the release of catecholamines.  Electroencephalograph changes have been observed, with alpha and beta wave activity increased and theta decreased. Increases in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline have been observed among betel nut chewers. \n\n> In 65 patients with schizophrenia, a decrease in positive symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was observed among men who were high-consumption betel nut chewers (more than 7.5 whole betel nuts/day).

Adequate luminal distention can usually be achieved with oral hyperhydration, thereby obviating nasoenteric intubation and making CT enterography a useful, well-tolerated study for the evaluation of diseases affecting the mucosa and bowel wall. Unlike routine CT, which has been used to detect the extraenteric complications of Crohn disease such as fistula and abscess, CT enterography clearly depicts the small bowel inflammation associated with Crohn disease by displaying mural hyperenhancement, stratification, and thickening; engorged vasa recta; and perienteric inflammatory changes.

This went beyond the previous advice which said that children were less likely to develop allergies if exposed to peanuts early; they had enough evidence to make a positive recommendation:\n\n> Existing guidelines pertaining to the early introduction of complementary foods have indicated that the introduction of highly allergenic foods, such as peanut, need not be delayed past 4 or 6 months of life.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> There is now scientific evidence (Level 1 evidence from a randomized controlled trial) that healthcare providers should recommend introducing peanut-containing products into the diets of \u201chigh-risk\u201d infants early on in life (between 4 and 11 months of age) in countries where peanut allergy is prevalent because delaying the introduction of peanut can be associated with an increased risk of peanut allergy.\n\nin 2017 this was codified [into a recommendation by the National Institutes of Health][2]. From the [addendum for parents][3]:\n\n\n> Guideline 1 recommends that if your infant has severe eczema, egg allergy, or both (conditions that increase the risk of peanut allergy), **he or she should have peanut-containing foods introduced into the diet as early as 4 to 6 months of age**. \n>\n> Guideline 2 suggests that if your infant has mild to moderate eczema, he or she **may have peanut-containing foods introduced into the diet around 6 months of age to reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy**. \n>\n> Guideline 3 suggests that if your infant has no eczema or any food allergy, **you can freely introduce peanut-containing foods into his or her diet**. \n\nThough it is suggested to \"[c]heck with your infant\u2019s healthcare provider before feeding your infant peanut-containing foods.\"\n\nThese recommendations were contemporaneously reported [in mainstream press][4].\n\n## Evidence for exposure to other allergens early in life\n\nThis is tricker to answer as there hasn't been a single focused study with evidence comparable to LEAP. \n\n### Asthma\n\n\nOne study looked at 514 children between birth and 24 months, and [concluded that those who are exposed to \"spores and pollen in the first 3 months of life are at increased risk of early wheezing\"][5]. \n\nSimilarly, there may be some correlation between early sensitivity to house dust mite (HDM) & grass pollen and [month of birth due to seasonal variations][6]. [Asthma itself seems to vary by month of birth][7].\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these relations don't necessarily imply that early exposure causes the sensitisation- as ever, *correlation does not equate to causation*.\n\n### Sensitisations or Tolerance\n\nA [2017 review on the subject of allergy development][8] (**PDF**) is more equivocal:\n\n> It is becoming increasingly clear that antigen exposures during the first few years of life are unique in their capacity to either elicit allergic sensitization or result in tolerogenic responses.\n\nIt has been proposed that [cutaneous exposure (through the skin) is more likely to result in *sensitisation*][9]; whereas oral exposure is more associated with a  [development of tolerance][10].\n\nInterestingly, it would seem that cutaneous exposure to peanuts -- for example  peanut dust entering via break in skin -- can drive intestinal sensitivity and perhaps [prevent oral tolerance][11].\n\n### Prenatal exposure\n\nWhile not technically in the scope of your question, there is interest in what \neffect [prenatal exposure][12] -- positive and negative -- can have on allergy development.\n\n# Pets\n\nEvidence here is inconclusive as well. Some studies show a benefit to early exposure, while others link it with the development of an allergy. A [2009 review discusses the evidence][13].\n\n> Over the past decades, numerous studies have investigated the role of pet exposures in relation to atopy, but the published findings have been inconsistent and sometimes conflicting. Although there is growing evidence that exposure to pets may protect against development of atopic outcomes, the protective effects have not been replicated in all studies.\n\nSince then, there has been further evidence on both sides, for example a [large Swedish study which showed that animal exposure could be protective against asthma development][14] (reported in [mainstream press][15]); wile another study from Finland concluded that pet exposure was [associated with a higher incidence of pet allergy][16].\n\n[1]: https://waojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40413-015-0076-x\n[2]: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/guidelines-clinicians-and-patients-food-allergy\n[3]: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines-parent-summary.pdf\n[4]: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/05/babies-peanut-allergies-health-guidelines\n[5]: http://thorax.bmj.com/content/64/4/353#ref-1\n[6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6640888\n[7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1514665\n[8]: http://users.unimi.it/minucci/Molecular%20Immunology%20Module2017-18/Allergic%20diseases/Early%20life%20factors%20that%20affect%20allergy%20development%20(allergy%20review)%20(1).pdf\n[9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560412\n[10]: https://www.nature.com/articles/mi20124\n[11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15969667\n[12]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753947/\n[13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783630/\n[14]: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2467334\n[15]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34697408\n[16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25735463", "15288": "# Herbal medicines do have side effects\n\nThe answer to any *\"does this have side-effects?\"* question is  invariably *yes*. \n\nSome drugs/medications/herbal remedies will have fewer side effects, some will have more.

Parents of children with the condition become generally aware of problems in their child\u2019s development around 30 months of age; however, they may experience significantly longer delays and greater frustration in obtaining a confirmation of diagnosis from clinicians. The practical implications of delayed diagnosis may affect adversely the prognosis in the case of the more able children with Asperger\u2019s disorder. [\u2026]<br>\n> In the adult years, patients with Asperger\u2019s disorder may experience increased anxiety due to stresses associated with independence and vocational demands. Educational and behavioral inclinations can be aimed at problem-solving strategies, self-understanding strategies, and management of anxiety and other comorbidity. [\u2026] <br>\n> From the conclusion:  Awareness of Asperger\u2019s disorder\u2019s distinctive clinical features and understanding of its historical background, epidemiology, and course, could eventually lead to more effective evaluation and management of these patients. Although the validity and usefulness of an Asperger\u2019s disorder-specific diagnostic concept is far from resolved, it is our hope that this review will assist clinicians in evaluating and managing patients with this lifelong disorder and subsequently improve their long-term prognosis.\n\nThat means that the criteria for diagnosis are far from perfected and since it was already correctly noted, these imprecisions are on a spectrum with increasing difficulties to establish valid diagnostic criteria at the extreme ends of this spectrum. It is further complicated by the research focus being mainly on childhood problems and treatment. Adult Asperger's is far less researched and conclusions might be clouded by simply transposing findings from childhood Asperger's onto Adults.\n\nSo, are there really \"benefits\" from being diagnosed AS as an adult? There sure are some! But benefits often come with a cost. These have to be considered in an informed decision making process.\n\n> [**Screening Adults for Asperger Syndrome Using the AQ: A Preliminary Study of its Diagnostic Validity in Clinical Practice:**][2]\n>\n> With **increasing demands on clinical services to assess for the possibility of Asperger Syndrome,** as demonstrated by the large number of referrals currently received at our clinic in Cambridge, it is important to be able to identify those people who are most likely to have AS. We believe our results support the AQ as a useful screening instrument in clinical practice. It provides a quick and reliable method of determining the likelihood of any individual falling on the higher functioning end of the autistic spectrum and warranting further, more detailed, assessment. We suggest that a more conservative threshold score of 26 would ensure that false negatives are limited, and equally avoid cases \u2018slipping through the net\u2019.<br>\nHowever, if the AQ were being used in a general population screen (and the ethical case for such a use has yet to be demonstrated) the higher cut off of 32 is likely to minimise false positives. **We suspect that this is because in the general population there may be a percentage of individuals who have many autistic traits but who do not require any clinical support (and are not seeking this) because of a good cognitive match between their cognitive style or personality, and their family or occupational or social context** (Baron-Cohen, 2003). **In this sense, whether a high AQ score becomes disabling may depend on environmental factors (tolerance by significant others, or being valued for contribution at work, or a place in a social network, protecting against the risks of secondary depression) rather than solely on factors within the individual. This impression warrants systematic research.**<br>\nOf importance is that seventy-five percent of the patients seen in the clinic had been referred by their general practitioner. This figure represents all suspected cases referred by primary care practitioners as no one was excluded simply based on their AQ score.<br>\nTherefore our results are also relevant in the primary care setting where, as a result of increasing awareness of autistic spectrum conditions, there is likely to be an increase in the numbers of patients seeking assessment. The GP has the difficult task of deciding who should be referred on for in-depth assessment. We believe the AQ will facilitate this process, and is particularly useful in this setting as it is a relatively quick and easy to use screening instrument. There is increasing evidence that by diagnosing even relatively late much can still be done to effectively manage the social impairments and facilitate better social inclusion.\n\nThat seems to indicate a certain 'trend' seen in clinical settings: with increasing awareness of the existence of this 'syndrome' or 'situation' or 'condition'. This is not to say it is a fad or fashionable label to attach to someone or her behaviour. But some psychological or psychiatric diagnosis approaches clearly fell out of fashion some time ago. Recently few women were diagnosed with hysteria and officially even fewer people are now 'treated' for being homosexuals.\n\n\n> [**\u2018How can a chord be weird if it expresses your soul?\u2019 Some critical reflections on the diagnosis of Aspergers syndrome:**][3]\n> This paper questions the way in which the diagnosis of Aspergers syndrome has come to be widely accepted and used as an essentially medical category. It does so by drawing upon sociological and historical analyses of society, psychiatry and psychology, as well as the writings of service users, other practitioners in the autistic spectrum disorder field and the author\u2019s own clinical experience. It is argued that the seeming popularity of this label within Western society may have as much to do with widespread social and cultural change during recent decades as with the supposed deficits of those who attract the diagnosis. The aims are to ask what this might mean for health and social care practice in this field and to encourage the growth of theories and approaches that are grounded more firmly in an awareness of the social environment, while also reflecting the varied experiences and standpoints of people who carry this label.<br>\n>**Conclusions** \nAs a worryingly elastic diagnostic label, Aspergers syndrome seems to be capable of extension to a wide range of individuals who might otherwise have little in common save their isolation, their apparent interpersonal awkwardness, their dislike of change and, in a socially and vocationally competitive age, the understandable concern of their families. Of course, it has to be acknowledged that for many the diagnosis has its uses. For those who are able to negotiate the current health and social care systems acquisition of this label may open up pathways towards financial and material assistance and also towards improved personal assistance at school, college or work, all of which may be badly needed and, when made available, may make the person\u2019s world an altogether more benign place. There may also be some advantage to being diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome, where the alternatives might include the more pejorative labels of \u2018psychosis\u2019 or \u2018schizophrenia\u2019.<br>\n> And yet this kind of intervention and support can come at a price. Erstwhile helpers can become focused upon imparting narrow psychological or social skills based \u2018solutions\u2019 at the expense of seeking a broader understanding of the social and familial roots of the individual\u2019s problems or of trying to challenge conventional ideas of what is normal or natural (Molloy and Vasil 2002). While there are no medical treatments aimed specifically at Aspergers syndrome, the indications of high rates of psychiatric drug prescribing for people in this group is worrying. This is a situation that cannot be altogether unwelcome to drug manufacturers keen to market their wares and the suspicion that autistic spectrum disorders are being widely promoted with an eye to future developments in pharmaceutical technology, or simply as a way of finding an expanded market for currently available products, is not altogether implausible (see, for instance, D. Boyle 2003).<br>\nGiven the doubts about the coherence and validity of the diagnosis, there is the nagging thought that in many, and perhaps most, instances what we are talking about is not so much a clearly demarcated \u2018developmental disorder\u2019 as a spectrum of character traits or dispositions that fit poorly with the ethos of our current business and consumer culture. More frequently than is recognised, the \u2018problems\u2019 presented by Aspergers syndrome may lie in a world that increasingly struggles to accept any form of difference from the notional norm unless, of course, such difference can be repackaged as a form of deviancy, illness or developmental difficulty, ready and waiting to be \u2018managed\u2019 by a set of self-appointed experts.<br>\nPerhaps as health professionals and even as friends and relatives of \u2018people with Aspergers syndrome\u2019 we might, in the words of one service user, try to embrace the sentiments expressed by the singer Joni Mitchell, who is reputed to have said in defense of one of her tunes \u2018How can a chord be weird if it expresses your soul?\u2019 Such acceptance (and the ability to genuinely listen that implicitly goes with it) would surely not represent anything like a complete answer to the difficult and complex questions that have been raised here, but it might be a good place to start.\n\nTo sum it up: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X04000197\n  [2]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10803-005-3300-7?LI=true\n  [3]: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687590903534254", "14592": "Even if this will be just a partial answer, it might help to \"better understand the process of creating systematic reviews\", as given in the comments.\n\nOne obvious answer to give here is: *all* of the abstracts have to be read, once the papers turn up \"positive\" within the (re-)search strategy for the literature. After all they have to be evaluated for inclusion or exclusion. <br>\nIf the original question is meant to ask for the average number of studies actually used, i.e. a hard number of included papers into the review, then the answer is quite different:\n\nFrom [Terri Pigott: Advances in Meta-Analysis, Springer, 2012:][1]\n\n> Another common question is: How many studies do I need to conduct a meta-analysis? Though my colleagues and I have often answered \u201ctwo\u201d ([Valentine et al. 2010][2]), the more complete answer lies in understanding the power of the statistical tests in meta-analysis. I take the approach in this book that power of tests in meta-analysis like power of any statistical test needs to be computed a priori, using assumptions about the size of an important effect in a given context, and the typical sample sizes used in a given field. Again, deep substantive knowledge of a research literature is critical for a reviewer in order to make reasonable assumptions about parameters needed for power.\n\n\nIt therefore depends on how well studied and researched a field or a research \nquestion is to select the reviewed papers from. Highly fashionable topics with controversy attached will have hundreds or thousands to choose from, niche interests, unprofitable venues perhaps only a few. To request a statistic across all of these fields of clinical systematic reviews is entirely possible. But one of the problems associated with [meta-analyses][3] is the so called garbage-in-garbage-out problem: such an undertaking \u2013 of not only \"estimate how many paper abstracts medical researchers read when preparing a clinical systematic review?\" but even precisely calculate that number \u2013 might be in danger of producing meaningless numbers, only useful for journalists or politicians.\n\nOne article providing just such a meta-meta-analysis does list such a number as requested in the question for the sub-field of psychology: 51 (range 5\u201381). (doi: 10.1080/00273171003680187\n[A Meta-Meta-Analysis: Empirical Review of Statistical Power, Type I Error Rates, Effect Sizes, and Model Selection of Meta-Analyses Published in Psychology.][4]) But it also  highlights the problems inherent with such an approach quite nicely:\n\n> - Effect Sizes and Heterogeneity in Meta-Analysis\n> - Model Choice:<br>\nFixed-effects models were used with much greater frequency than random- effects models, often without overtly stating that such a model was being used. On the other hand, random-effects models were used with increasing frequency over time. Future studies should more routinely implement random-effects models given their greater validity from an inference standpoint. <br> Finally, it is important to consider that use of random-effects models will lower power for significance tests in most cases (i.e., when the between-study variance is greater than zero).\n\nMore general we might guard against blind trust into reviews or meta-analysis in general. Currently, the field of medicine strives to rebuild its knowledge on an evidence based foundation, which is of course very welcome. But in pursuing this goal with overly confident concentration on quantitative data and mathematical models, a child in the bathtub might get hurt. Naming, using or just believing in any kind of 'gold standard' (or variously even platinum) will be too much on one extreme side. That is pictured as follows:\n\n[![research hierarchy, p4 of Cleophas Modern Meta-Analysis Review and Update of Methodologies][5]][5]\n\nThe biggest problem with that picture is that \"the filter\" is quite ill defined and regularly studies with higher statistical power or greater significance are chosen to be included. While sounding logical at first this violates philosophical principles, on principle, like Carnap's \"[Principle][6] of [Total Evidence][7]\". This mechanistic reasoning introduces therefore its own set of systematic bias.\n\n\n\nTo address several of these known dangers, pitfalls and shortcomings the [PRISMA statement][8] is an [initiative][9] to at least standardise the approaches and document transparently the procedure chosen for these types of analyses.\n\n\nMore epistemological problems are condensed in [Stegenga: \"Is meta-analysis the platinum standard of evidence?\" (2011):][10]\n> [\u2026] meta-analyses fail to adequately constrain intersubjective assessments of hypotheses. This is because the numerous decisions that must be made when designing and performing a meta-analysis require personal judgment and expertise, and allow personal biases and idiosyncrasies of reviewers to influence the outcome of the meta-analysis. The failure of Objectivity at least partly explains the failure of Constraint: that is, the subjectivity required for meta-analysis explains how multiple meta-analyses of the same primary evidence can reach contradictory conclusions regarding the same hypothesis. [\u2026] However, my discussion of the many particular decisions that must be made when performing a meta-analysis suggests that such improvements can only go so far.<br> For at least some of these decisions, the choice between available options is entirely arbitrary; the various proposals to enhance the transparency of reporting of meta-analyses are unable, in principle, to referee between these arbitrary choices. More generally, this rejoinder from the defenders of meta-analysis\u2014that we ought not altogether discard the technique\u2014over-states the strength of the conclusion I have argued for, which is not that meta-analysis is en- tirely a bad method of amalgamating evidence, but rather is that meta-analysis ought not be considered the best kind of evidence for assessing causal hypotheses in medicine and the social sciences. I have not argued that meta-analysis cannot provide any compelling evidence, but rather, contrary to the standard view, I have argued that meta-analysis is not the platinum standard of evidence.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461422778\n  [2]: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/1076998609346961\n  [3]: http://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/WBI/es.shtml\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26760285\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/moyhs.png\n  [6]: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/\n  [7]: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.5442&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n  [8]: http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097\n  [9]: http://www.prisma-statement.org\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22035723", "14124": "Apart from monks and nuns who showcase impressive abilities Wim Hof is onto something. One anecdote reads as follows:\n\n> [I\u2019ve also experienced the positive changes myself, [\u2026] My cardiovascular and muscular endurance has increased substantially too, with a reduction in my run times, thanks to the over-saturation of oxygen to my cells, activation of my autonomic nervous system and the overriding my hypothalamus, and the changing of my body\u2019s pH level to a more alkaline state. All the changes to my physiology from practicing the Wim Hof Technique consistently, has improved my overall health and athletic performance considerably.][1]\n\nBut anecdotes from believers are of course not very useful. Scientists are nevertheless intrigued by all those world records Hof has collected:\n\n> [At first this seems a ridiculous idea, because our body\u2019s innate immune system has long been known to operate in an autonomic fashion: we can\u2019t voluntarily control it. But what if this understanding was wrong? Dutchman Wim Hof, better known as \u201cthe iceman\u201d, certainly thinks so. Hof holds several world records for withstanding extreme cold, such as immersion in ice for almost 2 hours. Over the years, he developed techniques that allowed him to withstand low temperatures. These include meditation, breathing methods and repeated exposure\nto cold. But he also made the outlandish claim that he could exert control over his immune system. In 2011, although we were sceptical, we put Hof\u2019s claim to the test. \\[\u2026\\] When we got back to the Netherlands, we tested the volunteers\u2019 immune responses using the endotoxin model. The results were remarkable: the volunteers trained by Hof, who practised the breathing techniques during the experiment, showed exceptionally high adrenaline levels \u2013 even higher than those measured in people bungee jumping for the first time (PNAS, vol 111, p 7379). They also reported fewer flu-like symptoms, experienced lower fevers and had cytokine levels of less than half those of the control group. These results show, for the first time, that it is indeed possible to voluntarily influence the SNS and hence the innate immune system.][2]\n\nThe same study in a peer reviewed journal comes with more data:\n\n[Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans][3]:\n\n> **Significance**\nHitherto, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system were regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. The present study demonstrates that, through practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program, the sympathetic nervous system and immune system can indeed be voluntarily influenced. Healthy volunteers practicing the learned techniques exhibited profound increases in the release of epinephrine, which in turn led to increased production of anti-inflammatory mediators and subsequent dampening of the proinflammatory cytokine response elicited by intravenous administration of bacterial endotoxin. This study could have important implications for the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases in which therapies that antagonize proinflammatory cytokines have shown great benefit.\n\n> **Abstract**\nExcessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.\n\nA second study also sees changes resulting from practicing the technique, this time stripping the method of its Asian mysticism parts and thereby westernising it:\n[Neurocognitive and somatic components of temperature increases during g-tummo meditation: legend and reality:][4]\n> Stories of g-tummo meditators mysteriously able to dry wet sheets wrapped around their naked bodies during a frigid Himalayan ceremony have intrigued scholars and laypersons alike for a century. Study 1 was conducted in remote monasteries of eastern Tibet with expert meditators performing g-tummo practices while their axillary temperature and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were measured. Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3\u00b0C) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods. Without meditative visualization, both meditators and non-meditators were capable of using the Forceful Breath vase breathing only for a limited time, resulting in limited temperature increases in the range of normal body temperature. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of the g-tummo technique might help non-meditators learn how to regulate their body temperature, which has implications for improving health and regulating cognitive performance.\n\nThat sounds indeed promising. But in what way remains mostly unclear. \"Attenuating immune response\"? Well, lowering the immune system's activity might be a bad idea in relation to cancer, putting a brake on overshooting inflammatory processes might be good. Is any of this studied in a larger group? Is any of this studied over a longer time frame?\n\n*Temporary* short time hyperventilation or even hypoxia may have some kind of [training][5] [effect][6] that *might* lead to improved oxygenation of body tissues overall. Doing this repeatedly or routinely may also have quite [unwelcome][7] effects. But the *local* 'tumor hypoxia' effects of cancer that appear as [sustained][8] under-oxygenation of the affected cells are not necessarily the same as what happens in breathing a few times like the Hof.\n\n> [There is, however, a string attached to the Wim Hof Method, **that is the risk that people may think the method is scientifically valid.** Wim is a wholehearted speaker, but his scientific vocabulary is galimatias. With conviction, he mixes in a non-sensical way scientific terms as irrefutable evidence. Many less scientifically literate people believe what he says and several seriously diseased people have used his method as the final straw. Stories of believers circulate on the Internet, in popular magazines and are broadcasted as well. **The scientific investigations are often presented with a biased view.** <br> \nWhen practicing the Wim Hof Method with a good dose of common sense (for instance, not hyperventilating before submerging in water) and without excessive expectations: it doesn't hurt to try. **Although the effects on our health wait to be proven, people may feel healthier.**<br>\nAll in all, I think it is worthwhile to sort out whether and which of the training aspects of Wim's method affect our immune system and metabolism. And, with respect to the extreme challenges, is Wim special? Or are we all, as he himself proclaims, ice(wo)men?][9][emphasis added]\n\n### Summary\n\nSo, Wim Hof is onto something. But what is it? [Western][10] [science][11] has optimised [meditation][12] [techniques][13] and [proven][14] many benefits one can gain from these practices, even in their archaic or [mysticised][15] form. Better breathing patterns and more activity as opposed to sedentary life are without question positive changes for many 'civilised' people. \n\nThis answer assumes a somewhat mediated approach to the technique. There are always [extreme][16] cases that seem to invalidate a common sense evaluation. Trying to do this in a \"cancer prone\" individual? The relation to cancer seems currently indirect at best. If you overdo it, and what is meant by that is completely undetermined, it is very probably bad. As Taylor above has found this post:  \n[13 observations after 5 months and 200+ sessions of Wim Hof Breathing Method][17] some aspects become quite clear though: 120 minutes sessions, doing in a car or in icy water, and possibly alone, there are quite a number of such immediate risks involved in practicing this to these extremes. How much more likely cancer is due to these exercises if done so often and so long to *really* stress out and damage the system is not known via scientific studies. Overdoing it will very probably lead to very unwelcome effects, like driving off the road, so quickly that any increase in risk for cancer will be moot.\n\n\nUnless this Hof-method or the tummo meditation are more researched we have to conclude for now that there are many anecdotes but almost no real evidence as defined to our standards that this works either way or better than simply \"do more sports\". Only indicators, but a few, point into the direction of overall improved health, if one doesn't faint from the hyperventilation. \n\n\n\n\nBeing the optimist I await much more studies on this. Until those arrive: I guess it doesn't hurt much, it doesn't help much.\n\n---\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.tdathletesedge.com/blog/2017/7/2/guest-blog-by-vince-tsai-the-power-of-breathing\n  [2]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407914616274\n  [3]: http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.short\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612090/\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045191\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023329\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053942\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17656037\n  [9]: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2017.1329001\n  [10]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308621597\n  [11]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527303003504\n  [12]: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2009.0044\n  [13]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032705002570\n  [14]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360859209000230\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020861\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15136413\n  [17]: https://probablyhealthy.com/2016/02/15/13-observations-after-5-months-and-200-sessionsof-wim-hof-breathing-method/", "14058": "Yes. T2D is reversible, with some caveats.\n\nT2D is essentially a set of symptoms in a body that has ingested too much sugar, and has lost insulin sensitivity. \"Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.\" --wikipedia  Diabetes_mellitus_type_2\n\nT2D is an arbitrary diagnosis based on the easily-measurable blood glucose level: wikipedia Diabetes_mellitus_type_2#Diagnosis\n\nOutside the arbitrary medical definition, which has a binary diagnosis, it's much more meaningful to talk about insulin sensitivity as a spectrum.\n\nSome people are insulin-sensitive superstars, far better at efficiently digesting sugars than \"normal\" people, and generally speaking T2 diabetics are less insulin-sensitive than normal people.\n\nA helpful analogy is IQ. The arbitrary definition of moron is a person with IQ between 50-69, an imbecile has an IQ from 20-49, and idiots have IQs below 20. That's pretty easy to measure, and also pretty meaningless. A much more useful application of IQ scores is to try to make ALL people improve their own individual IQ score over time through education.\n\nWe don't focus enough on the fasting blood glucose level, or response of blood glucose level to ingested sugar *as a spectrum of insulin-sensitivity*. Instead, we just have 1 label, T2D. Kinda like if we ignored geniuses, morons, and regular people, and just had a single \"disease\", called \"dumb\", for people with an arbitrary IQ, let's say below 73.\n\nWhen you ask about reversing diabetes, what you're really asking is, can a person use diet to improve their insulin sensitivity, as measured by fasting blood glucose, and/or response of blood glucose to ingestion of sugar. The answer is **yes**!\n\n***Diet is the strongest factor in improving insulin sensitivity.***\n\nCarbs are just sugar chains consisting of 3 or more sugars, so it's useful to divide all nutrition into simply sugar, fat, and protein, and never use the word carbs again. Just call them long-chain or complex sugars, so you don't camouflage diabetes-inducing sugars as nutritive-sounding \"carbohydrates\".\n\nEating very low-sugar diets (ketogenic, atkins, or even many low-calorie diets) improves insulin sensitivity. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313649/\n\nHere are some caveats:\n\n 1. Most, if not all, T2Ds are terrible eaters who consume(d) loads  of sugars, so dietary changes are difficult for many T2Ds.\n\n 2. Some damage caused by eating sugar is irreversible. If you got your legs sawed off because you were extremely insulin-resistant for a long time, they won't grow back. Somewhere around 100,000 diabetes leg amputations happen every year in the US. This is a huge problem.\n\n 3. Reversal is slow, unless the person commits to a very drastic change, like a ketogenic diet (for most people this means <40g of sugar per day). Humans usually believe in lucky positive events, and expect to see immediate feedback from any changes, but most important achievements in life require small investments of energy and attention every day, over periods of months or years. This is why so few people are financially secure, physically fit, happily married, well-adjusted, and healthy. All of the important problems in life require consistent attention and near-daily investments of effort in PROCESSES over long investment horizons. The positive events, like winning Mr. Olympia, cover modelling on Forbes, and celebrating a happy 50th anniversary, aren't really \"events\", so much as results flowing naturally from slow, consistent processes. The behaviors that will reverse T2D are not comfortable, and your aunt will have to take those actions every day for months before seeing any positive results.\n\nIf you can make your aunt see that sugar caused her T2D, and that not eating sugar will reverse it, and she carries a powerful enough \"WHY\", such as not getting her legs sawn off, being able to hike mountains with her nieces and nephews, living a long and happy life, then she will start substituting fat for sugar in her diet, and live happily ever after.\n\nJust be aware, it's a psychological battlefield, and the same thinking and actions that got her where she is will NOT get her out.\n\nOther Sources:\n\n - http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2017/09/type2diabetesisreversible/\n - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2#Diagnosis", "14022": "Although the initial question seems crazy enough from the start, the preamble to this answer has to make it clear that you should not use a water boiler with tea \u2013 or anything else but water \u2013 in it. This answer has to assume that the question is about: only green tea or plain water used directly in the boiler. \n\nDoubting that there are really people so much after the IgNoble that [real studies][1] have been conducted to test this. Even if called unsolicited advice: just don't do that. Reasons and alternatives follow:\n\nThe boiler should [not contain][2] any [plastic][3] (which might leach plasticzers and [other][4] [chemicals][5] into the water) or heat spirals that are not made out of stainless steel (since [some][6] of the [old type spirals][7] may leach [nickel][8] and [other metals][9] [into][10] the water). [What to use then? Glass and stainless steel, or a traditional pot/kettle.]\n\nBoiling [tea][11], and especially [green tea][12], will absolutely ruin the [taste][13].\n> Steeping too hot or for too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality.\n\n\nIf you want to go the convenience path that seems to have inspired this idea: put your [tea][14] into a cup and put that into [a microwave][15]: \n\n> And, extraordinarily, Mr Gorman advocates something which - had they been invented - Orwell would surely have balked at; using a microwave to make tea.\nMr Gorman, whose organisation represents tea packers, brokers and importers, said: \"Usually when people's tea goes cold they reboil the kettle and make another cup. But doing this you are guaranteed to give yourself a dull cup of tea. You need freshly drawn water for a good cup because reboiling it takes out all the oxygen and nitrogen out of it.\u201d\n\n> He added: \"A better solution is to put it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds. When you microwave tea all you're doing is from a scientific point of view is just moving the molecules around and getting it back up to a decent temperature. It is not impacting the flavour at all.\"\n\nCleaning the water boiler with strong detergents [may leave some of these detergents behind][16]. That is presumably the most dangerous health problem with the approach outlined in the question (provided that the kettle itself is really fit for food grade application).\n\nIf the discolouration bothers you or starts to impact the boiling efficiency: soak it in [soda][17]. Tea stain will then come off so easily that you might use a very mild and [eco-friendly][18] simple soap to keep it shiny clean. Rinse thoroughly.\n\nYou won't attempt brain surgery with shards from your kettle? So it becomes an argument of common sense that you will not need absolute sterility. Boiling [fresh water][19] of [decent quality][20] will kill enough microorganisms (that will be in there in very small numbers to begin with). [Even baby bottles are now free from this germ-o-phobe advice.][21]\n\nKeep in mind that high quality tea like [Gyokuro][22] or Fancy White should be prepared with a water temperature of [*below* 70\u00b0C][23]! Tea can also be [cold brewed][24] (no sterilisation at all).\n\nFinally, the [inventors of tea][25] have the following to say:\n\n**[Yixing clay teapot][26]:**\n\n> Yixing teapots are meant for use with black and oolong teas, as well as aged p\u01d4\u2019\u011br tea. They can also be used for green or white tea, but the water must be allowed to cool to around 85 \u00b0C (185 \u00b0F) before pouring the water into the pot. Yixing teapots absorb a tiny amount of tea into the pot during brewing. After prolonged use, the pot will develop a coating that retains the flavour and colour of the tea. It is for this reason that soap should not be used to clean Yixing teapots. Instead, it should be rinsed with fresh water and allowed to air-dry.\n\n[How to Season an Yixing Teapot][27]:\n\n> Other info: Never use anything but water to clean an yixing pot. Soap will be absorbed and create a permanent soapy flavor in the tea you steep. Always allow your yixing pot to dry completely between uses, and before replacing the lid and storing. A teapot stored wet with the lid on will mold. If your teapot molds, reboil for 10-15 minutes and re-season. Take a picture of your pot when you start using it so that you can compare in a year to see how it has grown. \n\n# tl;dr\n\nWhile this 'boiling the tea directly in the kettle' is not a good idea for a number of reasons, the negative health impacts from the tea residue alone should be negligible.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.academiaobscura.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RSC-tea-guidelines.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4063249/\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222987/\n  [4]: https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/ToxicityReviewOfDINP.pdf\n  [5]: http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sct/documents/out12_en.pdf\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23712458\n  [7]: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/feb/07/science.research\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel#Toxicity\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21749233\n  [10]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10209881\n  [11]: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/tea-fact-sheet\n  [12]: https://nccih.nih.gov/health/greentea\n  [13]: http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/how-to-brew-green-tea-where-to-buy.html\n  [14]: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/tea#safety\n  [15]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/23/never-boil-water-twice-making-cuppa-tea-guru-warns/\n  [16]: http://oem.bmj.com/content/41/2/279.full.pdf\n  [17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate\n  [18]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25560657\n  [19]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3545/why-is-it-a-bad-idea-to-re-heat-drinking-water\n  [20]: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/B:RESB.0000040010.64651.f9.pdf\n  [21]: https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/should-you-sterilize-your-babys-bottles\n  [22]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyokuro\n  [23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea#Brewing_and_serving\n  [24]: https://nutritionfacts.org/video/cold-steeping-green-tea/\n  [25]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tea_in_China\n  [26]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixing_clay_teapot\n  [27]: https://verdanttea.com/how-to-season-yixing/", "13968": "You can't.\n\nConsidering that [agar][1] melting temperature is approximately 85-95C / 176-185F and coals burns at around 200C / 392F at rest, providing temperature of at least 100C / 212F inside the bowl, agar will ultimately liquefy.

It acts roughly like Lantus, but its increased concentration gives it slightly different properties in terms of timing. The most interesting aspect of Toujeo is that it does not appear to wane \"too early\" as Lantus often does with many users (Lantus can wane sometimes in as little as 18 or 20 hours for some individuals).

Cold showers boost recovery after exercise: Athletes often take ice baths after vigorous training do reduce soreness. You don\u2019t have to take it that far, but you can obtain a similar benefit with a quick cold shower after your training sessions.\n\n2. Cold showers increase mood and alertness: When cold water pours over your body, your breathing deepens in response to the shock of the cold (this is your body trying to keep you warm by increasing overall oxygen intake). Your heart rate will also increase, resulting in a rush of blood through your body that will help you get energized for the day.\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\n1. Cold showers burn fat: There are two kinds of fat in your body: white fat and brown fat. White fat is the body fat we all know and struggle to get rid of. When we consume more calories than our body needs to function and we don\u2019t burn those calories for energy, they are stored as white fat. Brown fat,\"the good fat\", is activated when we're exposed to extreme cold in order to generate energy and keep our body warm.Cold showers also speeds up your metabolic rate which helps to lose fat.\n\n2. Relieve depressive symptoms: \"A lifestyle that lacks certain physiological stressors that have been experienced by primates through millions of years of evolution, such as brief changes in body temperature(e.g cold swim) and this lack of \"thermal exercise\" may cause inadequate functioning of the brain.\n\n3. Cold showers strengthen immunity and circulation: Remember how I mentioned that cold showers speed up your metabolic rate, which helps you lose fat? The increase of this rate activates your immune system, which releases virus-fighting white blood cells that will help you get sick less frequently. Cold showers also increase your overall blood circulation, which can help you avoid hypertension and the hardening of arteries.\n\nBut still there are various temperature degrees of cold water that may harm the body while some relieves it.

Morning cortisol is not a definitive test for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.<sup>1</sup> That is because cortisol varies according to a circadian rhythm (i.e. with your body's sleep-wake cycle).  \n\n![caption](http://i.imgur.com/XVXTq23.png)\n\nThe x axis represents time across a 24h day.<sup>2</sup> The transition from dark yellow to light yellow indicates the habitual wake time.

As shown on the graph above, this is predictably a trough (i.e. low point) in serum cortisol. On the other hand, the \"normal\" range is likely calibrated for the *peak* level. (This test is supposed to be done shortly after waking, approximating the peak.) The fact that a value below the normal range was obtained is predictable. \n\nFor this reason, a confirmatory test is required to make the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. This generally involves administration of [ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)][acth] &ndash; the physiologic stimulator of cortisol production &ndash; and assaying cortisol levels at fixed intervals afterward to evaluate for an adequate rise. Only after inadequate adrenal response is demonstrated can the diagnosis be made.<sup>3</sup> \n\nIn direct response to the OP's questions, then:\n\n> It is normal to treat low cortisol levels....? \n\nNo, except in exceptional circumstances, a confirmatory test is required before treatment. \n\n> It is normal to treat...without symptoms?\n\nThe [symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are notoriously vague][niddk], and the OP indicates that there actually was some complaint prompting the testing. Inadequate treatment of adrenal insufficiency can go unnoticed until a stressor triggers a life-threatening condition known as [adrenal crisis](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000357.htm).  If a true inadequate response to ACTH is demonstrated, this should be treated. \n\n> Is it normal to not do it any further screening of possible causes (my doctor didn't)?\n\nIt is standard to follow a low cortisol level with a ACTH stimulation test. On the other hand, if this is only mildly below the reference range of your lab, given the likelihood that what has actually been measured is closer to a trough than a peak cortisol level, one could imagine a scenario where it might be reasonable to drop it. In addition to the reference range, the details of the presenting complaint and any physical exam or laboratory abnormalities would be necessary to make a decision in that regard.

Post surgery, if the patients are bed ridden for too long, blood tends to accumulate in their calf muscle where there is a secondary blood pump that is active only if those muscles are working. Pooling of blood in the calf muscles increases the risk of formation of clots there, and these clots may be sent to lungs causing pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary embolism is a potentially life threatening state, and requires immediate treatment. So if the patient is at risk for developing pulmonary embolism before the surgery, the doctor would want to get in you on your feet as soon as possible. But if the patient is having too much difficulty while walking then there are equipment like calf massagers that does the job. Also, getting the patient on feet early creates a positive attitude and has shown to [improve and speed up recovery][1] in patients. \n\nThat said, there are conditions where the doctor would want you to do absolute bed rest, such as the conditions where there is increased risk of suture getting ripped due to increased abdominal pain.

It gives an overview over several studies, for example one where 144 heterosexual couples where only one partner was infected were tracked. \n\n> Transmission occurred in 14 (9.7%) of the couples, including 13 in which diaries were maintained during the period when transmission occurred. Although 4 couples (31%) reported sexual contact during the prodrome (1 case) or within hours before lesions were first noted by the symptomatic partner (3 cases), in 9 cases (69%) transmission resulted from sexual contact when the source partner reported no symptoms or lesions\n\nPCR studies found that over 80 percent of people showed asymptomatic shedding, on around 20 percent of the days. \n\nSo the likelihood probably wouldn't dramatically decrease just because the infected partner is asymptomatic. \n\nHSV1 in the genital region [is becoming][2] [more common][3]. It is responsible for between 20 and 40 percent of genital herpes. Part of that increase might be from oral sex, but there is no single likelihood figure that can be attributed to a single instance of unprotected oral sex, at least that I can find. \n\n> what is the likelihood if the person contracting it has already been exposed to oral HSV1 as a child?\n\nIt's possible. Again, we can't really attach a number to that risk. [Even people with genital HSV-1 can be infected with another strain of HSV-1 genitally, afterwards being infected twice.][4] \n\n> Whereas the sequential HSV-1 isolates in 11 of the 13 patients studied had the same genotypes, the sequential isolates of 2 patients showed a different genotype. The data suggest that HSV-1-induced recurrent genital herpes can be associated with genital reinfection with an exogenous HSV-1 strain.\n\nSmall sample size, but we only care that it's possible at all here. \n\n> If genital HSV1 is contracted, how long does it usually take to find out? (when would symptoms start to appear)\n\nThis varies, not just by a lot of time, but it even varies whether people *ever* show symptoms. The [incubation period is a few days][5], but around [one third][6] of patients may not show symptoms at all. Even more may not recognize them as a herpes infection. HSV-1 also [recurs less often][7] after the first outbreak. This leads to a lot of people not even knowing they are infected. Combined with the asymptomatic shedding of the virus, this leads to [HSV being a rather prevalent disease][8]. And not even serological testing is [over 90 percent certain to detect an infection][5]. The CDC does recommend that patients who have probably been exposed should be tested, though. \n\n(The part of this answer about asymptomatic shedding is taken from an answer written by me to another question [What STDs can be transmitted if both parties have no open sores/cuts][9] ) \n\n\n  [1]: http://m.jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/198/8/1098.full\n  [2]: http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/181/4/1454.short\n  [3]: http://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Fulltext/2003/10000/Is_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_Type_1__HSV_1__Now_More.13.aspx\n  [4]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.20132/abstract;jsessionid=B906EF4B7C7AD8481B571773C1ED1838.f03t02\n  [5]: http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10547406\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804398/\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47447/\n  [9]: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1924/what-stds-can-be-transmitted-if-both-parties-have-no-open-sores-cuts", "4022": "What you are hearing about is probably based on two articles:\n\n1.

The mice also showed improvement in cognitive function. Mice are often used as model organism's in Alzheimer's studies, because we have transgenic mice that show symptoms of nerve degeneration. For some reason, this research used a different strain of mice that shows nerve degeneration as early as two months. Usually in Alzheimer's studies in mice, another strain is used that shows symptoms much later. That doesn't need to be a bad thing, just something I found interesting. The authors are optimistic about their study, but do recommend caution:\n\n> These characteristics could be a disadvantage for evaluating drug candidates that are moderately efficacious and could be overlooked when tested in such an aggressive model, as opposed to the common more moderate models which may recapitulate the slower progression of AD in humans.

In that setting, compounds found in cinnamon reduced the formation of aggregates of the protein tau, which is also involved in the [formation of Alzheimer's][6]. \n\nBasically, both studies suggest that some ingredients in cinammon can reduce two factors that we believe are involved in how Alzheimer's Disease progresses : \naccumulation of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide, and formation of  neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein. \n\nIt's promising, but so far, no study in humans has been done and we can't say for certain whether these compounds can slow down or even halt the progression of Alzheimer's.

However, it does seem like the effects of long-term caffeine use may be negligible.\n\nAlso, be careful to differentiate between long-term effects of caffeine on memory and the effects of caffeine on long-term memory!

Since you're being treated for cellulitis, it's likely that this infection is responsible for your current low cholesterol (which would be confirmed if your cholesterol returns to normal after treatment). \n\nSadly I can't be more precise than this answer as there is, as far as I know, no specific study on cholesterol levels in people treated for cellulitis.\n\nSources:\n\n - [Hypocholesterolemia in clinically serious conditions][1]    \n - [Hypocholesterolemia][2]\n - Medical experience\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19219206\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20957025", "3735": "Referring to published [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/), there is no known quota on drinking frequency since fluid intake from beverages and food in time period takes care of the total hydration status of an individual in a day. Daily consumption below the range of adequate intake of water may not produce harmful effects to the body because hydration is received from intake of beverages and foods other than the normal water intake.\n\n[Research](http://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6#74) into hydration reveals humans must maintain water balance in order to stay healthy. Humans receive hydration i.e. water from daily food and water intake, and generally lose water in the form of sweat, urine and exhalation. Drinking water is beneficial in those with a water deficit particularly due to dehydration which can be caused by other factors such as diarrhea, vomiting, burns etc.\n\nThe recommendations on adequate intake of water which includes total water intake (water from beverages and food) is found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/table/T6/).\n\n> Over the course of a few hours, body water deficits can occur due to reduced intake or increased water losses from physical activity and environmental (e.g., heat) exposure. However, on a day-to-day basis, fluid intake, driven by the combination of thirst and the consumption of beverages at meals, allows maintenance of hydration status and total body water at normal levels.", "3264": "I haven't found any studies that would directly link retching and the consumption of tea. However, this would be a rather narrow research, so the lack of it is no surprise. Your doctor told you that your acidity problems may be caused by tea and that this might be causing your gags, and they are correct.\n\nIt has been proven that consumption of tea is directly related to increased secretion of gastric acid (1):\n\n> The gastric acid response to a 200-ml cup of tea was measured [...] Tea resulted in an acid secretory response which was almost equal to that after a maximal dose (0.04 mg/kg) of histamine. The effect of tea was mainly due to its local chemical action on gastric mucosa. Tea without milk and sugar resulted in an acid response higher than that evoked by a maximal dose of histamine. The concentration of tea brew that had the greatest effect on gastric acid secretion was 15 g/200 ml, which was three times as much as that in a palatable cup of tea. Tea is a potent stimulant of gastric acid, and this can be reduced by adding milk and sugar.\n\nThis effect of tea is most likely caused by caffeine, which was proven to increase gastric secretion in animals and humans. (2, 3)\n\nTherefore tea can have some adverse effects (4):\n\n> *Green tea and green tea extracts contain caffeine. Caffeine can cause insomnia, anxiety, irritability, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, or frequent urination in some people.*\n\n______________________\n*[Some sources](https://books.google.rs/books?id=pDa2QgAACAAJ&dq=pdr+for+herbal+medicines+2000&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y) state that increased gastric secretion and possible irritation of gastric mucosa are caused by chlorogenic acid and tannins, which is why these effects are reduced by addition of milk. Other sources, however, state that both [chlorogenic acid](https://www.google.com/patents/US4865847) and [tannins](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/np50082a022) reduce gastric secretion.\n_____________________________\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Many other treatment modalities show no real effect.

It was about NSAIDs and tissue healing: https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1406/anti-inflammatory-painkillers-and-healing/1750#1750.\n\nAs so, I would conclude that diclofenac patch indeed has some benefits. But from pragmatic approach I would not recommend using those patches before and during an effort. The pain in your elbow is an indicator for microscopic damage, mostly tears, and swelling. If you apply the patch before an effort the signal is suppressed and you might strain your tendon more than it would be physiological or reasonable. This leads to even more severe tendinopathy and I would consider that a vicious circle. Suppressing pain when it is indicating tissue damage is not advisable in my opinion.\n\n\n----------\n\n(1) Sayegh, Eli T., and Robert J.

Use of paper bag as an emergency measure for person with a panic attack is very cost-effective without any potential side effects so it is an ideal \"intervention\". So I think we should not crave for solid evidence. Due to the factoid matter majority of people *think* it is an effective treatment and with comes a great placebo effect which should be definitely used due to the cost-effectiveness and safety. \n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3254702/\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901344", "1604": "According to [this review article][1], adults need a bit more than 1 gram of calcium per day. However, it may be the case that the natural vitamin D levels for the human body should be a lot higher than what is currently the norm, see e.g. [here][2]. Calcium is absorbed from the gut by both passive and active mechanisms, the active mechanism is vitamin D dependent. If the level of calcium in the blood drops then calcium from bones will be released and simultaneously, the kidneys will produce more calcitriol which then turns on genes in the gut to produce enzymes that help to extract calcium from food.\n\nBesides the total intake per day, what is also relevant is the presence of big gaps in the intake of calcium. Such gaps will prompt the body to extract calcium from the bones and then you're dependent on processes that will eventually put  calcium back into the bones. By spreading the intake of calcium over the day, you can prevent bone loss in the event that in your case this mechanism of putting the calcium back doesn't work as well as it should.\n\nNote that there are many sources of calcium that we tend to ignore. Water can contain calcium, e.g. where I live there is 60 mg per liter. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if you drink 3 liters a day, you'll get 180 mg. Bread only contains 10 mg per slice, but if you eat a lot like I do (I don't recommend doing that unless it fits into a well balanced diet for your case) like 15 slices per day, then that's 150 mg of calcium. So, the dry bread plus water alone is already 280 mg.\n\nThen if you eat 500 grams of broccoli at dinner like I did today, you'll get 235 mg of calcium. Potatoes contain 12 mg per 100 gram, I had 1 kg of potatoes for dinner, so I got 120 mg from the potatoes. This means that in total I got more than 600 mg of calcium from sources one normally doesn't bother to consider. However, it must be said that absorption of calcium from such sources isn't as efficient as from dairy products due to oxalates in vegetables, phytic acids in grains and the lack of phosphorous when you drink just plain water.\n\nSo, you see that non dairy sources can give you a decent amount of calcium, but you then need to eat a lot (I eat about 4000 kcal per day, which is a lot more than average). The calorie intake of indigenous people who needed to jog for hours every day to chase prey was likely a lot higher than what it is today for the typical office worker, so they may actually have gotten their gram of calcium per day from only non dairy foods and their vitamin D levels were also likely a lot higher than that of the average office worker. \n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-27302006000400014\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264449", "1522": "To answer this question, first it might be useful to talk about how a vaccine actually works: basically, through introducing dead or relatively harmless (attenuated) versions of a virus or bacteria (or more recently, synthetic virus-like particles meant to mimic the outside of a virus), you induce a reaction by your immune system to defend itself.\n\nAs your immune system remembers pathogens it's encountered before based usually on a protein encountered on the outside of the virus or bacteria (an antigen), when it encounters the real deal, it can defend itself.\n\nWhich means the ability for a vaccine to work depends *entirely* on your body's ability to recognize the vaccine you were given and the pathogen you encounter as \"the same\".\n\nThis, in turn, is a function of how fast the virus evolves. Some viruses, like influenza, have genomes that are very conducive to swapping between strains. This is known as [antigenic shift][1]. Other viruses, [like HIV][2], have relatively rapid evolution brought on by methods of copying their genomes that are \"sloppy\" or error prone. This is sometimes called antigenic drift (influenza does this as well).\n\nBoth of these mechanisms make it likely that, over time, the difference between the vaccine and the virus is such that your body will no longer recognize one as the other.\n\nIn contrast to RNA viruses like HIV and influenza, viruses that have their genomes stored as double stranded DNA, like smallpox, have [much lower error rates][3], which means antigenic drift is less of a problem, and it's not prone to antigenic shift. This means that a vaccine developed against it wasn't made ineffective by the virus evolving such that it didn't provoke an immune response (known as antigenic escape).\n\nThis stability made smallpox an excellent target for a vaccine, and the lack of stability is why developing a long-lasting vaccine against influenza and HIV is so difficult.\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_shift\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937799/\n  [3]: http://www.virology.ws/2009/05/10/the-error-prone-ways-of-rna-synthesis/", "94": "There are a few considerations when looking at a healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.\n\n**Complete Proteins**\n\nThis is fairly easy in this type of diet, as eggs contain complete proteins. There are also a few plant sources (such as quinoa, buckwheat and hempseed) that contain either a complete protein profile or the 9 essential amino acids in good amounts. Hempseed also contains Omega-3 fatty acids which can be difficult to get without seafood.\n\n**Healthy Fats**\n\nOne of the main reasons for healthy fats in the diet is for the proper transport of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) into the body. Nuts and avocados are examples of healthy fats, as are olives and olive oils. If possible, for olive oils get extra virgin and as fresh as possible, as this will ensure the highest levels of polyphenols.\n\nAlong with the basic considerations, you need to be aware of possible deficiencies due to age, sex, things of this nature. For example, [this study][1] suggests that B-12 deficiency can be a problem in pregnant lacto-ovo vegetarians. High soy intake can possibly impact estrogen levels in both men and women, and possibly delay maturation/height in maturing individuals, although this is only a precaution (most of what I've read suggests further studies are needed).\n\nI would talk with a nutritionist and/or doctor about the diet, and why you want to follow it.

For example, if your gastroenteritis was caused by a norovirus (formerly called Norwalk virus, the most common cause of food poisoning), a blood test for IgM (Immunoglobulin M) to the virus, indicating a recent illness, might be positive.\n\nHowever, diagnosing after the fact in a short term and self-limiting illness like norovirus infection is harder than diagnosis during the illness (which requires just a small stool sample), unless the pathogen is known with certainty, and even then, there may not be a residual response to test.\n\nClearly, you will be paying for a large number of tests with only a chance that one of them will come up positive.\n\nIn terms of getting a doctor's note, it's best if you a) have a prior relationship with the physician, b) call him while you're sick (not after) or c) see a health care provider, go to the school health clinic, a walk-in clinic, or something similar.\n\nWriting a note after the fact is a tricky area ethically. Many doctors who know and trust their patients will do it without hesitation. But I can understand others simply refusing the request for a post-illness work-up (which might be negative regardless) on the basis of cost and questionable need.\n\nOr to use a medical metaphor, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\n\n\n\n<sub>[Antibody Test To Detect Genogroup II Norwalk-Like Virus Infection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC85428/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Assessment of a rapid immunochromatographic test for the diagnosis of norovirus gastroenteritis.](http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/22354525)</sub>", "1051": "Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), especially very high strength H2O2, can be very dangerous and can cause some serious health risks and possibly even death. \n\nA United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement made in 2006<sup>[1]</sup> says that drinking high strength H2O2, specifically H2O2 of 35%, is extremely dangerous and can cause several serious side effects. \"Ingesting hydrogen peroxide can cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration.\" It can also cause other health risks, some of which can be life threatening. \n\nAnother article from 2007<sup>[2]</sup> talks about a specific incident in which a 39 year old man accidentally drank 250mL of 35% H2O2. Though the man did not experience the worst possible side effects, he did have to go to the hospital and he did experience damage in his stomach. This is a good example of a real life situation in which H2O2 was consumed, and it did not turn out well. Another real world example<sup>[3]</sup> turned out much sadder. A 2 year old girl swallowed two sips of 35% H2O2 and died. This happened because of a [cytotoxic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity) (cell-killing) injury in the tissues and formation of oxygen gas ([oxygen toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity)) caused by the H2O2.\n\nIngestion of 35% H2O2 is undeniably dangerous, but what about lower concentrations of H2O2, such as 3%? A study from the 1990's<sup>[4]</sup> studied 670 cases of mostly children being exposed, usually orally, to 3% H2O2. \"Exposure to hydrogen peroxide 3% is usually benign, however, severe gastric injury may occur following small ingestions in children.\" Overall, they found that a majority of the children were not affected by the low concentration H2O2, but there were special cases in which bad outcomes did occur. \n\nOverall, we can see that safeness of drinking H2O2 varies depending on what the concentration is. High concentrations, 35%, are extremely dangerous and should never be consumed, but low concentrations, 3%, present low risks. Now, the question is do the benefits of 3% H2O2 outweigh the risks. \n\nI have been unable to find any reliable sources showing that health benefits of drinking H2O2 of any concentration. Usually, it is used as a topical solution for minor cuts and wounds, not as something to be taken orally. Though the ingestion of 3% H2O2 hasn't been shown to be consistently dangerous, there have been cases of damage in the stomach and other parts of the body.<sup>[5]</sup> H2O2 poisoning can be very dangerous, even with low concentrations of it, so I would not recommend drinkin H2O2, ever.

A majority of the studies tested the effects of a rotating oscillating electric toothbrush against a manual toothbrush. Overall, they found a 21% reduction in plaque and an 11% reduction in gingivitis. \n\nThere are some things that weren't found by the studies that were reviewed, mainly what the long-term dental benefits of electric toothbrushes. Also, side effects were rarely reported, so there was no sufficient evidence of whether electric toothbrushes can be harmful to your teeth. \n\nA study done in 2008<sup>[2]</sup> tested oscillating powered toothbrushes against manual toothbrushes over a 9 month period. It started with a 3 week period of oral care. Then some people brushed twice daily with either an oscillating powered toothbrush, a manual toothbrush, and a manual toothbrush and flood together. The powered toothbrush was able to keep the levels of plaque lower than the other two groups and also help prevent gingival bleeding. Another 2010 study<sup>[3]</sup> also found very similar results in which the oscillating toothbrush help reduce plaque and prevent gum bleeding. From these studies and many others, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are better for your teeth than manual toothbrushes.\n\nThere is another type of electric toothbrush, sonic toothbrushes. They work by vibrating the brush head at sonic speeds. Though there are more studies done on oscillating toothbrushes, there have been a few done on the effectiveness of sonic toothbrushes. This 2015 study<sup>[4]</sup> found that sonic toothbrushes were significantly better at reducing plaque than manual toothbrushes. An earlier study published in 2014<sup>[5]</sup> also found that sonic toothbrushes were more effective at plaque removal. They also found that for a short time (1 week), the sonic toothbrushes were better at reducing the risk of gingival inflammation. After 3 weeks though, the amount of papillary bleeding (bleeding in some parts of the mouth) were the same between those who used sonic toothbrushes and manual toothbrushes. Overall though, it seems that sonic toothbrushes are also better for your oral health than manual toothbrushes.\n\nSo we can see that both main types of electric toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes. But which is better, sonic toothbrushes or oscillating toothbrushes? In fact, a handful of studies has been done on this topic.\n\nA 2013 study<sup>[6]</sup> tested the two types of powered toothbrushes. Both the sonic and the oscillating toothbrushes were able to significantly reduce plaque and risk of gingivitis, but the results showed the oscillating toothbrush performed better than the sonic toothbrush. Three 2014 studies<sup>[7], [8], [9]</sup> agree with the conclusion that oscillating toothbrushes are better at reducing plaque and gingival bleeding than sonic toothbrushes. All of those studies were performed very similarly and had some of the same researchers between them. From these results, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are superior to sonic toothbrushes.\n\nFor both electric toothbrushes, we can see that risk of gingivitis and the amount of plaque on the teeth are reduced. You did ask more thing which I will answer more directly.\n\n> Are there really any long-term benefits associated with electric toothbrushes?\n\nWell, from the trials I've mentioned, we can see that this is most likely the case. The longest trial I directly mentioned<sup>[2]</sup> was 9 months long and it showed that 9 months of consistently using an electric toothbrush did help reduce plaque and gingival bleeding. Manual toothbrush can keep your teeth clean, but it takes more work than an electric toothbrush.\n\n**Why doesn't everyone use an electric toothbrush if they are proven to be better?**\n\nWell, there are a few things that come into play<sup>[10]</sup>. Even though electric toothbrushes are more effective at cleaning teeth and they don't take as much work as manual toothbrush, some people aren't willing to pay so much for a toothbrush. Some of the cheapest electric toothbrushes cost only $5, but the higher quality ones can go for over $100. You can get a five pack of manual toothbrushes for under $5. Another con of electric toothbrushes is that they are a hassle. They are bigger, and they require batteries or they have to be charged. Some people just don't want to deal with that. Lastly, electric toothbrushes can be easily broken. If you drop it, that might be it and you just lost $10. Now, electric toothbrushes are becoming more popular, but some of these cons are still holding people back.\n\n---------- \n\n<sup>[[1]]  [Powered/electric toothbrushes compared to manual toothbrushes for maintaining oral health][1]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[2]]  [PComparison of the use of different modes of mechanical oral hygiene in prevention of plaque and gingivitis][2]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[3]]  [Manual orthodontic vs. oscillating-rotating electric toothbrush in orthodontic patients: a randomised clinical trial][3]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[4]]  [Is a new sonic toothbrush more effective in plaque removal than a manual toothbrush?][4]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[5]]  [Toothbrush efficacy for plaque removal][5]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[6]]  [A 12-week clinical comparison of an oscillating-rotating power brush versus a marketed sonic brush with self-adjusting technology in reducing plaque and gingivitis][6]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[7]]  [A randomized clinical trial evaluating gingivitis and plaque reduction of an oscillating-rotating power brush with a new brush head with angled bristles versus a marketed sonic brush with self-adjusting technology][7]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[8]]  [A randomized 12-week clinical comparison of an oscillating-rotating toothbrush to a new sonic brush in the reduction of gingivitis and plaque][8]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[9]]  [A six-week clinical evaluation of the plaque and gingivitis efficacy of an oscillating-rotating power toothbrush with a novel brush head utilizing angled CrissCross bristles versus a sonic toothbrush][9]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[10]]  [Manual Toothbrush VS Electric Toothbrush: Pros and Cons][10]</sup>\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18672987\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21250772\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793947\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738786\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282870\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25831599\n  [8]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122979\n  [9]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122976\n  [10]: http://www.jeffersondentalclinics.com/blog/2014/04/30/manual-toothbrush-vs-electric-toothbrush-pros-and-cons-jefferson-dental-clinics/", "959": "There is evidence that a muscular arm will produce a higher systolic reading if the wrong sized cuff is applied.\n\nThere are two measurements in a blood pressure reading, the systolic and the diastolic.

The interactions in molecular level, brain, vestibular system and in structural biomechanics are extremely complex and authors conclude quite fairly: \"Many factors are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of adolescent scoliosis, leading some authors to formulate a complex collective model from these different concepts.\"\n\nAs so there is not currently any explicit evidence which would state the harms of any static risk factors (sleeping) affecting to development of scoliosis. Partly due to this vagueness I think the debate regarding risk of scoliosis is prone to bias and emotional \"truths\" and wisdoms.\n\nIn a recent population level study, authors found that sleeping in hammock was inversely associated to scoliosis [(Baroni et al.)][3]. Still, it's possible that this study failed to take into account the possibility that children with scoliosis might be less likely to sleep in a hammock because of possible back pain in the morning. Correlation (or inverse correlation) does not imply causation.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293085/pdf/1748-7161-6-26.pdf\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566252/pdf/11832_2012_Article_458.pdf\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340998/pdf/je-25-212.pdf", "690": "There has been a lot of debate over the topic of artificial sweeteners and weight loss. Some studies say that artificial sweeteners do promote weight loss, while others argue the complete opposite, that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain. \n\n**Do artificial sweeteners in diet products affect weight loss?**\n\nMost diet products use artificial sweeteners because they provide the sweetness of sugar without adding any extra calories. How this affects weight loss is uncertain. Several studies, both long term and short term, favor each side of the debate.\n\n[A 1988 study<sup>1</sup>][1] had two groups of obese men and women. Both groups were placed on the same diet, except that one group had aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in some diet products, added to the diet. Both groups also had regular exercise instruction. The men in both groups lost a significant amount of weight in the 12 week period, while the women, who also had good results, had more of a difference in the two groups, with the group whose diet was supplemented with aspartame losing about four more pounds on average. This showed that artificial sweeteners can help weight loss, but because the group was small (59), no firm conclusions could be drawn. \n\n[Another similar study<sup>2</sup>][2] also showed positive results in taking aspartame. In a group of 163 obese women, some of them assigned to have products with aspartame and some assigned to abstain from it, it was shown that having aspartame promoted more weight loss and allowed more weight control during a follow-up period. This study had more conclusive evidence than the previous study, but still not enough to be considered definite.\n\n[One more study<sup>3</sup>][3] whose results leaned towards artificial sweeteners promoting weight loss (but still inconclusive) tested beverages with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup (which I won't talk about because it's usually not used in diet products) on normal-weight men and women. The beverages with aspartame did appear, relative to when no beverages were given, to reduce weight in male subjects, but did not have a noticeable effect on females. Once again, this leaves us with an unsatisfactory result.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are some studies that say artificial sweeteners don't have any significant effect on weight or sometimes even promote weight gain. \n\n[A long-term study in San Antonio<sup>4</sup>][4] studied a few thousand people and asked them how often they drank beverages with artificial sweeteners. The amount of total consumption of artificial sweeteners was then estimated. About 7 or 8 years later, the subjects were re-examined and it was found that higher consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked with a higher body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. There are many other factors that could've changed this result, and they were handled as well as they could, but still not perfectly. Because of this, the result is once again inconclusive. The study article even says, \"There may be no causal relationship between [artificial sweetener] use and weight gain.\"\n\n[One last study<sup>5</sup>][5] also says that there is no evidence that artificial sweetener consumption \"helps weight loss or prevents weight gain.\" It showed no significant link between weight loss or gain and the amount of artificial sweeteners consumed. Of course, this study has many variables that were handled as adequately as possible, but still this leads to the real result of the experiment being inconclusive. \n\nAs we can see, it is nearly impossible to tell how artificial sweeteners affect weight loss. They're not really bad for your health, so it is fine to have them. It does seem that the studies that showed weight loss from artificial sweetener consumption had a higher percentage of weight difference than the studies that showed other results. From this you may conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks. The only thing I can recommend is to have artificial sweeteners in moderation, just like anything else.\n\n**Is there any benefit to choosing \"diet\" products instead over plain water?**\n\nThis can also be a controversial subject, but there are also studies on it. Sadly, they are inconclusive.\n\n[This study<sup>6</sup>][6] tested men and women with two groups, one was an artificial sweetener beverage group and the other was a water group. Both groups also took part in a behavioral weight loss treatment program. The results showed that the artificial sweetener group lost more weight on average than the water group. Still, this study was not large enough and did not have sufficient enough evidence to be considered conclusive.\n\nWhether diet products are better than water can still depend. You can argue the same as above that the benefits of artificial beverages outweigh the risks, but you could also say that water is a safe enough choice. This is usually up to whoever is debating between diet products and water, but your doctor can be contacted if the need is really felt. \n\n----------\n\n<sup>[[1]]  [An evaluation of the effect of aspartame on weight loss.][1]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[2]]  [The effect of aspartame as part of a multidisciplinary weight-control program on short- and long-term control of body weight][2]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[3]]  [Effect of drinking soda sweetened with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup on food intake and body weight][3]</sup>\n\n<sup>[[4]]  [Fueling the Obesity Epidemic?

Is that the case?\n\nIn a normal (i.e. lens intact) eye, that would, I think, be a problem.\n\nThe aqueous humor is a self-replenishing system, whereas the vitreous humor is made and completed before birth. There is no replenishment of it, although, because it is near a capillaries bed, there is diffusion of small molecules like glucose back and forth that takes place between the blood and the vitreous humor.\n\nYou're correct that the vitreous humor (initially a very well organized gel-like substance) liquifies as aging occurs, but the predominant effect of this is floaters (vitreous detachments*), retinal pulls, tears, hemorrhages and detachments.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\nFluid (aqueous humor) is produced by cells in the ciliary body (which is part of the ciliary muscle, with ligamentous connections to the edge of the lens) behind the iris. This fluid-filled space is called the posterior chamber. The fluid then passes from behind the iris into the anterior chamber, between the iris and the cornea, and finally drains through a permeable network (the trabecular meshwork) near the base of your the anterior part of the iris. So, there is constant production and drainage of aqueous humor, keeping the fluid level balanced.\n\nWhen too much fluid is made, or not reabsorbed, the anterior chamber bulges, deforming the shape of the vitreous humor and placing pressure on the optic nerve. There is no fluid exchange between the two unless there is disease of the posterior chamber.\n\nWhen the vitreous humor liquifies, the volume stays the same. If it could drain out of the trabecular meshwork, I would imagine there would be a much greater risk of more serious vitreous detachments and subsequent  retinal detachments.\n\nIn the case of a lens removed in childhood, the vitreous humor, being a highly organized gel, is probably little affected by lens removal. With age, because liquifaction happens from the middle of the vitreous; the effect of loss of the lens is still probably small, but I imagine - I'm not an opthalmologist - it might be different for someone who has had a lifetime to accommodate. \n\n(I might have to read and edit this answer again.)\n\n*<sub>Not the sole cause of floaters</sub>  \n<sub>cross-section image from [Patient.co.uk: Acute Angle-closure Glaucoma](http://www.patient.co.uk/health/acute-angle-closure-glaucoma)</sub>  \n<sub>[https://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_8/chapter_46.html](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_8/chapter_46.html)</sub>  \n<sub>[J Clin Pathol. 2003 Sep; 56(9): 720: Concurrent vitreous disease may produce abnormal vitreous humour biochemistry and toxicology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1770054/)</sub>\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/GcKKZ.gif", "530": "There is a study [described at nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243011/) about the rate of absorption of caffeine through the skin and how hair follicles contribute to it (\"significantly\", is apparently the answer to that).

In the studies, high doses of topical [retinyl palmitate][22] (a form of vitamin A) were shown to accelerate cancer (skin tumors or lesions) in lab animals that grew significantly faster than mice treated with vitamin-free cream (NTP 2009).\n\n![Low doses of Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) significantly speed growth of skin tumors and lesions in lab animals - chart][23]\n\n<sup>Source: EWG analysis of data from FDA photocarcinogenicity study of retinyl palmitate (NTP 2009). Percent decreases in time to development of a significant tumor or lesion (for animals exposed to cream laced with retinyl palmitate) are relative to that for animals exposed to cream free of the compound.</sup>\n\nScientists have known for some time that retinyl palmitate can spur excess skin growth (hyperplasia), and that in sunlight it can form free radicals that damage DNA (NTP 2000).\n\nPrevious data were preliminary, however in 2011 the link between [retinyl palmitate][24] (RP), sunlight and the increased risk of cancer has been confirmed by the National Toxicology Program after a year long [study on mice][25].\n\nThe [EWG][26] and and New York Senator Chuck Schumer have called attention to the fact that high doses of topical retinyl palmitate were shown to accelerate cancer in lab animals and [EWG][27] published the following [statement][28] (which was scheduled for immediate release):\n\n> A key independent science advisory panel has voted to confirm federal researchers' conclusion that retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A found in two-fifths of U.S. sunscreens, speeds the development of skin tumors and lesions when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight.\n\n> \"A compound that causes skin damage and tumors on sun-exposed skin has no place in sunscreens or other daytime skin products,\" said Jane Houlihan, EWG senior vice president for research.\n\n> More than 200 sunscreens from 44 companies listed vitamin A or retinyl palmitate on their labels in 2010, according to EWG's analysis of beach and sport sunscreens with SPF ratings of 15 or higher.\n\n> In light of those findings, EWG recommends that manufacturers of cosmetics, sunscreens and other personal care products remove retinyl palmitate from all products to be used on sun-exposed skin and that consumers avoid buying products that contain this chemical.\n\nDespite of that [sunscreen controversy][29], another study from 2010 by JAAD determined that \"there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that [retinyl palmitate] in sunscreens is carcinogenic.\". Therefore EWG  has since refuted this analysis directly<sup>[(2011)][30]</sup>.\n\nA panel of independent scientists convened by the NTP in January 2011 unanimously **confirmed the study\u2019s conclusion that retinyl palmitate \u201cenhanced the photocarcinogenic activity\u201d of sunlight** (NTP 2011).\n\n> The strong scientific consensus that has formed around the NTP-FDA vitamin A study has afforded the FDA an exceptional opportunity to take a bold public health stand on a cosmetic ingredient that has proven harmful in multiple studies<sup>[(2011)][31]</sup>.\n\nSince then the FDA has set a minimum performance standard for sunscreens that use the term \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d to denote that they provide a measure of protection from ultraviolet-A rays.\n\nThe most recent government scientific study from August 2012 by NTP has demonstrated that **retinyl palmitate speeds photo-carcinogenic effects on test animals** and concluded that diisopropyl adipate increased incidence of skin tumors in mice, and the addition of either retinoic acid or retinyl palmitate both exacerbated the rate and frequency of tumors<sup>[(2012)][32],[(PDF)][33]</sup>. The study (Photococarcinogenesis Study Of Retinoic Acid And Retinyl Palmitate) was conducted at a federal research center co-hosted by the FDA and NTP, found that mice treated with **small doses of retinyl palmitate and ultraviolet light developed skin tumors faster than untreated**, light-exposed mice or those treated only with a control cream. There were **more numerous tumors on every animal treated with retinyl palmitate**.\n\nAnd the conclusion was:\n\n> Under the conditions of these studies, the topical treatment of SKH-1 mice with the control cream resulted in earlier onsets of in-life skin lesions and higher incidences and multiplicities of in-life skin lesions, when compared to untreated controls, in the absence and presence of SSL.\n\n![Retinyl palmitate and light cause animals to develop skin tumors faster - chart - NTP][34]\n\n<sup>This graphic presents skin tumor onset data for female and male mice exposed to the amount of UV light equivalent to 30 percent of the UV dose that causes sunburn in people. The bottom axis indicates weeks of retinyl palmitate + light treatment. (NTP 2010).</sup>\n\nThe sunscreen industry and its paid consultants have rejected the NTP findings.\n\nWhether RP in sunscreens is carcinogenic is a controversial issue for the cosmetics industry and FDA is reviewing data from several studies since July 2009. Nearly 33 years after it began considering regulation of sunscreen products, the FDA has yet to review or certify the safety of chemicals formulated into sunscreen products.\n\nEWG supports FDA\u2019s proposal for further testing to determine the potential phototoxicity and/or photocarcinogenicity of diisopropyl adipate.

Thus, **there is an obvious need for high-quality basic science studies and controlled clinical trials in examining the effects corticosteroids on various tendon disorders**.\n\nBased on above studies, the effect of local corticosteroid injection(s) for tendon disorders is unknown. The extent of the tendon problem, the duration of the symptoms, and the phase of healing at the time of injection are factors that may modify the efficacy and side effect profile of this procedure.

It is calculated as the number of times per hour that the airway partially or completely collapses, associated with a drop in oxygen levels.  Partial collapse is labeled a hypopnea, whereas complete collapse is labeled an apnea. CPAP treatment uses air pressure delivered through a mask to stent open the airway. *If there continues to be partial or complete collapse despite CPAP, the basic idea, in theory, is that the pressure is inadequate.*\n\n**The major caveat**: \nWhere are you getting this AHI? Most likely, you\u2019re reading it off a PAP machine. The upshot of this answer is that, as much as we all love numbers, such readings should not be trusted.\n\nThe AHI was initially validated in the setting of overnight polysomnography, i.e. a sleep lab. There a technician watches the tracings generated from a nasal pressure transducer, chest/abdomen effort belts, and continuous pulse oximetry. There are specific criteria for scoring apneas and hypopneas. The recommended [criteria from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine][AASM] for a hypopnea are now:\n\n> a. The peak signal excursions drop by \u226530% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure...\n\n> b. The duration of the \u226530% drop in signal excursion is \u226510 seconds.\n\n> c. There is a \u22653% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline and/or the event is associated with an arousal.\n\nThere has been **a lot** of controversy in recent years as to whether that number in the c criterion should be 3% or 4% drop in pulse oximetry. **Why should we care?**    \n\nThe number you\u2019re getting off your PAP machine has no pulse oximetry to correlate with. They must therefore be using some *other* non-standard metric. How do they calculate this? This, unfortunately, is proprietary information known only to the PAP manufacturers. Occasionally there are validation studies of varying quality published, but there is no uniformity in the industry as to what algorithm is used, and there is very little transparency about where these numbers are coming from. \n\n**What, then?**   \nMonitoring of sleep apnea treatment is symptom-based. If symptoms improve, good enough, keep with it. If there is inadequate improvement or recurrence of symptoms after improvement, things should be re-evaluated. Generally this involves one or more of the following:   \n\n- assessing the interface (Is the mask leaking? That will cause inadequate pressure delivered to the airway.)\n \n- home overnight pulse oximetry  \n\n- adjustment of the settings on an auto-titrating machine to allow for higher pressures  \n\n- empirically increasing the pressure on a fixed-pressure CPAP  \n\n- a repeat sleep study while using PAP, adjusting the pressure settings (i.e. a titration study)\n\n**Conclusion**: Most likely, in the next few years these technologies will get better, and hopefully transparency and uniformity will improve. In the meantime, take the AHI number on your CPAP machine with a grain of salt.\n\n------\n<sub>\nKryger, Roth, Dement. *Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine.* Chapter 107: Positive Airway, Pressure Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome. pp 1219-1232.\n</sub>   \n \n<sub>\nEpstein, LJE, et al.

[Mostly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456285/), these target different receptors (than the SARS family), except for NL63.\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\n> The host receptor is a major determinant of pathogenicity, tissue tropism and host range of the\nvirus. The S protein comprises of two domains: S1 and S2. The interaction between the S1 domain and\nits cognate receptor triggers a conformational change in the S protein, which then promotes membrane\nfusion between the viral and cell membrane through the S2 domain. Today, the main host cell receptors\nutilised by all HCoVs are known: **aminopeptidase N by HCoV-229E, angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) by SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) by\nMERS-CoV and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1**.\n\n> Apart from the conventional endosomal route of entry, some CoVs may also gain entry into\nthe cell via the non-endosomal pathway, or a combination of both. The low pH in the cellular\nenvironment and endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins may help to facilitate membrane fusion and\nendosomal CoV cell entry . Recent evidence has supported the role of cathepsin L in SARS-CoV and\nMERS-CoV entry. Other host proteases, such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)\nand airway trypsin-like protease TMPRSS11D, could also perform S1/S2 cleavage to activate the S\nprotein for non-endosomal virus entry at the cell plasma membrane during HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV\ninfection. In addition, MERS-CoV is also activated by furin, a serine endopeptidase that has\nbeen implicated in the cell entry of other RNA viruses and S1/S2 cleavage during viral egress.\n\nIt's worth reading some of the more [in-depth papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16339146) on how NL63 entry differs from SARS (despite both using ACE2):\n\n>  Here we show that SARS-CoV, but not HCoV-NL63, utilizes the enzymatic activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin L to infect ACE2-expressing cells. Inhibitors of cathepsin L blocked infection by SARS-CoV and by a retrovirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein but not infection by HCoV-NL63 or a retrovirus pseudotyped with the HCoV-NL63 S protein. Expression of exogenous cathepsin L substantially enhanced infection mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein and by filovirus GP proteins but not by the HCoV-NL63 S protein or the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. Finally, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification had substantially less effect on infection mediated by the HCoV-NL63 S protein than on that mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein. Our data indicate that two coronaviruses that utilize a common receptor nonetheless enter cells through distinct mechanisms.\n\nhttps://jvi.asm.org/content/82/17/8887: \n\n> The S protein in the SARS-CoV spike apparently exposes a protease-accessible loop between the S1 and S2 subunits that can be targeted by different enzymes, such as cathepsin L, trypsin, and, under physiological conditions, local enzymes such as elastase. Consistent with the presence of such a loop, the syncytium-inducing capacity of expressed SARS-CoV S protein was dramatically enhanced after the introduction of a functional furin cleavage site in the S1/S2 junction region (8, 14). No such loop has been detected yet in spikes of HCoV-NL63 or of most other subgroup 1 coronaviruses. The resistance of the HCoV-NL63 spike ectodomain to cleavage by cathepsin L and trypsin that we observed here is in agreement with our inability to inhibit infection with HCoV-NL63 or an NL63 spike protein-pseudotyped retrovirus by using a broad spectrum of protease inhibitors (10). It is conceivable that during its low-pH-independent cell entry, HCoV-NL63 uses an alternative, possibly nonproteolytic way to activate the fusion function.\n\nSo yeah, it looks easier to block SARS than even the NL63 common cold using the same receptor...\n\nA more recent [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420302622), taking into account SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has proposed that the more general distinction between the common colds and the more deadly coronaviruses is that:\n\n> S glycoprotein trimers found in highly pathogenic human coronaviruses appear to exist in partially opened states, while they remain largely closed in human coronaviruses associated with common colds. [...] most pathogenic coronaviruses will exhibit S glycoprotein trimers spontaneously sampling closed and open conformations, as is the case for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\nAlso of note is that 229E and NL63 despite using different receptors are fairly related to each other, prompting the title of [one paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664609600668) \"close yet still so far [apart]\". (Those two viruses have 65% sequence identity, in retrospect less than SARS and SARS-CoV-2 similarity of around 80%.) But also\n\n> ACE2 belongs to the same protease family as CD13 [(also known as aminopeptidase N)]\n\nAlso of some interest, [in some immunoassay](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37747-5/figures/4) SARS scored as a mix of 229E and NL63 response (plus some specific response).

The thesis is that a live attenuated version of H1N1 (LAIV) was used by Chinese scientists who innoculated several 1000s military recruits. It likely was not attenuated correctly and reverted to a more virulent form in-vivo leading to the epidemic.\n\n> Between 1962 and 1973, almost 40,000 children participated in eight LAIV trials in the USSR (13). Scientists at the Peking Vaccine and Serum Institute in China also carried out clinical trials using live vaccines during the same time period (1). Additionally, there are records of the mass production of a live H1N1 vaccine in Odessa, USSR, in 1977 (14, 15). In the early days of research in the 1940s, LAIVs were often able to regain virulence upon administration to humans and cause disease (16). In addition, many strains isolated from the 1977 outbreak (for example, the A/Tientsin/78/77 isolate) were temperature sensitive (ts), meaning that the virus could not replicate at higher temperatures. Temperature sensitivity generally occurs only after a series of laboratory manipulations, typical in generation of LAIVs, and is used as a biological marker of attenuation. While not all of the 1977-1978 strains were temperature sensitive, a comparison of all 1977 strains shows a higher prevalence of the ts phenotype than in 1950 strains, supporting the claim that the outbreak may have resulted from attempts at attenuation for vaccine purposes (1, 17). The possibility that the 1977-1978 strain could have resulted from a LAIV trial was also mentioned in a personal communication from C. M. Chu, renowned virologist and the former director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to Peter Palese, who described \u201cthe introduction of this 1977 virus [as] the result of vaccine trials in the Far East involving the challenge of several thousand military recruits with live H1N1 virus\u201d (18). Whether this involved an ineffectively attenuated vaccine or a laboratory-cultivated challenge strain, the deliberate infection of several thousand people with H1N1 would be a plausible spark for the outbreak.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542197/", "23267": "To clarify the block quotes you posted, muscle soreness is a [rare negative side effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31958335) of isotretinoin.

Further support for the role of humoral immunity in the prevention and control of HRV infection was observed in a study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia.

It lowers blood glucose in multiple ways, including suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased peripheral insulin-mediated glucose uptake, decreased fatty acid oxidation, and increased intestinal glucose consumption. Metformin reaches maximal plasma concentration approximately 2 hours after ingestion, and its half-life ranges from 2.5 to 4.9 hours. Approximately 90% of it is eliminated in the urine in 12 hours. Among many side effects of the drug, metformin-associated lactic acidosis is one of them but rare. Although metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of one to five cases per 100\u2009000 population, it has a reported mortality of 30-50%.\n\n> The pathophysiology of lactic acidosis from metformin is likely due to inhibition of gluconeogenesis by blocking pyruvate carboxylase, the first step of gluconeogenesis, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Blocking this enzyme leads to the accumulation of lactic acid. Biguanides also decrease the hepatic metabolism of lactate and have a negative ionotropic effect on the heart, both of which elevate lactate levels. Metformin dose, along with the duration of exposure from accumulation in patients with decreased renal clearance, can cause lactic acidosis. The other contributing factors of lactic acidosis are congestive heart failure, liver disease, shock, alcohol use, hypoxic states, renal failure, sepsis, and advanced age.[Link][1]\n\nThe number of documented cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is small when one considers how widely metformin is used. That metformin has been used safely in patients with contraindications can be viewed as evidence that it does not cause lactic acidosis. On the other hand, cases of lactic acidosis from metformin overdose, particularly in young people without risk factor, suggest that metformin can cause lactic acidosis if given in large doses.\n\nFor immediate-release, the maximum recommended dose of metformin is 2550mg/day and\nfor extended-release, the maximum recommended dose is 2000mg/day and dose adjustment should be done for elderly patients, patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and other complications.[drugs.com][2],[mayoclinic.org][3]\n> Studies suggesting that a metformin plasma level of at least 40 mg/L (10 times the therapeutic level) may be necessary to cause lactic acidosis.\n[Link][4]\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/7/1791\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222034/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4264704/\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3660.full\n\nhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/714920\n\nhttps://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/8/1476\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4264704/\n  [2]: https://www.drugs.com/dosage/metformin.html\n  [3]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20067074\n  [4]: https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/8/1476", "20759": "In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), water gain and loss in 24 h can be measured from:\n\n - Water gain: drinking, tube feeding or intravenous infusion\n - Water loss: urine\n\nThere can be substantial additional loses via excessive sweating, vomiting and diarrhea, and those are not usually measured, but only estimated and may or may not be recorded.\n\nIf the question is, what can be a possible ***difference* between total water gain and loss in 24 hours,** I'd say roughly **10 liters** in each direction, but this is just what is _physiologically possible_ and not likely what they would allow to occur in the ICU, where +2 to -2 liters would be more realistic.\n\nIf we are talking about ***absolute amounts* of water gain and loss in 24 hours,** they could be both up to about **30 liters.** \n\n**Example 1: Treatment of severe dehydration.** A patient who loses 30 liters of water per day by diarrhea due to [cholera][1], would be treated by 30+ liters of fluid in that day. \n\n**Example 2: Excessive urine loss (polyuria).** A person gets 5 liters of fluid in a day, but due to excessive urination caused by diabetes mellitus, he loses 10 liters of fluid.

Preparing a too large portion of solution in advance and letting it sit, and the pots used themselves are:\n\n> **Although common and frequently based on potentially dangerous bacteria, contamination *is considered a false problem by some experts.* They think that the nasal cavity is naturally full of bacteria and the addition of new pathogens is not clinically relevant.**  \n\n> The problem of sterility of the solutions and devices has been debated. \n\n> **Solutions are at risk of contamination when large volumes of solution based on distilled water, bottled water, or boiled water are prepared at home, maintained in containers** and used each time when NI is needed by withdrawing the required amount of liquid. Devices can be contaminated when they are continuously used without adequate cleaning. Lee et al. reported that **after one and two weeks of use, irrigation bottles** used by adults undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery that were washed with hot soapy water after each use **were found to be contaminated by a large spectrum of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus**. Similar findings were reported by other authors and, because in many cases contaminating bacteria were the same as those that could cause acute rhinosinusitis, it was suggested that the main source of device colonization was the sinonasal cavities. The risk of contamination seems independent of the type of device. Additionally, the use of a one-way valve irrigation bottle, theoretically capable of reducing the risk of reflux of contaminated solution in the device, was found to be practically ineffective. In contrast, contamination seems to be influenced by the composition of the solution. It was shown that acidic, isotonic saline solutions were more frequently associated with bacterial contamination probably because some of the most common contaminants grow optimally in similar environmental conditions. Finally, contamination was found more frequently with longer durations of NI use. With some exceptions, studies have reported that both bottles and bulb syringes were contaminated after one to two weeks of use in approximately 25% of the cases and in 45% after four weeks.\n\n> <sub>\u2013\u2013 Nicola Principi & Susanna Esposito: [\"Nasal Irrigation: An Imprecisely Defined Medical Procedure\"][17], Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017 May; 14(5): 516. doi: 10.3390/ijerph14050516 PMCID: PMC5451967\nPMID: 28492494</sub>\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticaking_agent\n  [2]: https://sci-toys.com/ingredients/table_salt.html\n  [3]: https://www.erp4it.com/netinext/2011/04/the-focus-of-this-post-is-on-neti-as-a-regular-practice-in-the-american-bathroom-and-the-related-economic-and-usability-issu.html\n  [4]: https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/saline-sinus-rinse-recipe\n  [5]: https://digitalfire.com/4sight/hazards/ceramic_hazard_bentonite_toxicity_31.html\n  [6]: https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/7%20Salt%20and%20Preservatives%20FINAL%20RGK%20V2.pdf\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous_tartrate\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartrate\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/\n  [12]: https://www.nutritionmyths.com/aluminum-in-table-salt/\n  [13]: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/photo-stories/table-salt-can-be-poisonous/photostory/64385362.cms\n  [14]: https://www.fsai.ie/faq/additives/list.html\n  [15]: http://www.cfp.ca/content/49/2/168.full.pdf\n  [16]: https://hals-nase-ohren.com/nasendusche-hno-nuernberg\n  [17]: https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijerph14050516", "20451": "[Collagens][1] are a family of [fibrous proteins ][2](as opposed to [globular proteins][3] like enzymes and hormones and [membrane proteins][4] like cell receptors) that form part of [connective tissue][5].

The Panel notes that the three studies above are pilot single-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled parallel studies conducted with a product containing high oleic safflower oil, Haematococcus extract, lutein, vitamin A, vitamin E, gelatine and rosemary oil in addition to astaxanthin, and therefore no conclusions can be drawn from these studies on the food that is the subject of the health claim, astaxanthin, in relation to the claimed \neffect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of astaxanthin and the maintenance of normal joints, tendons or connective tissue.\n\n\nSo there is no evidence available supporting the use of Astaxanthin for the treatment of tennis elbow \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n(1)\n\nBioAstin, a natural astaxanthin from microalge helps relieve pain and improves performance in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome\n https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cyanotech.com/pdfs/bioastin/batl18.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjBpZz92fvjAhXBwsQBHSu5DM0QFjACegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw03Lg12cq8x4NKKAxHroM0y&cshid=1565556981743\n\n(2)\n\nA blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial on the use of astaxanthin as an adjunct to splinting in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome\n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280376/#__ffn_sectitle\n\n(3)\n\nScientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to \nastaxanthin\n http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1253\n\n  [1]: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cyanotech.com/pdfs/bioastin/batl18.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjBpZz92fvjAhXBwsQBHSu5DM0QFjACegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw03Lg12cq8x4NKKAxHroM0y&cshid=1565556981743\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280376/#__ffn_sectitle\n  [3]: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1253", "19869": "Consumption of 1-2 eggs per day is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the following systematic reviews of studies:\n\n[Egg consumption in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis (AJCN, 2013)][1]:\n\n> This meta-analysis suggests that egg consumption is not associated\n> with the risk of CVD and cardiac mortality in the general population.\n> However, egg consumption may be associated with an increased incidence\n> of type 2 diabetes among the general population and CVD comorbidity\n> among diabetic patients.\n\n[Impact of Egg Consumption on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes and at Risk for Developing Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Randomized Nutritional Intervention Studies (Canadian Journal of Diabetes, 2017)][2]:\n\n> Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that consumption of\n> 6 to 12 eggs per week, in the context of a diet that is consistent\n> with guidelines on cardiovascular health promotion, has no adverse\n> effect on major CVD [cardiovascular] risk factors in individuals at risk for developing\n> diabetes or with type 2 diabetes.

Moreover, CBD reduces alcohol-related steatosis and fibrosis in the liver by reducing lipid accumulation, stimulating autophagy, modulating inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells. Finally, CBD reduces alcohol-related brain damage, preventing neuronal loss by its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties.  \n**Conclusions:** CBD could directly reduce alcohol drinking in subjects with AUD. Any other applications warrant human trials in this population. By reducing alcohol-related steatosis processes in the liver, and alcohol-related brain damage, CBD could improve both hepatic and neurocognitive outcomes in subjects with AUD, regardless of the individual's drinking trajectory.

The endocannabinoid system plays an important role in common neurobiological processes underlying substance use disorder, in particular by mediating the rewarding and motivational effects of substances and substance-related cues. In turn, a number of cannabinoid drugs (e.g., rimonabant, nabiximols) have been suggested for potential pharmacological treatment for substance dependence. Recently, cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid found in the cannabis plant, has also been proposed as a potentially effective treatment for the management of substance use disorder. Animal and human studies suggest that these cannabinoids have the potential to reduce craving and relapse in abstinent substance users, by impairing reconsolidation of drug-reward memory, salience of drug cues, and inhibiting the reward-facilitating effect of drugs. Such functions likely arise through the targeting of the endocannabinoid and serotonergic systems, although the exact mechanism is yet to be elucidated. This article seeks to review the role of the endocannabinoid system in substance use disorder and the proposed pharmacological action supporting cannabinoid drugs' therapeutic potential in addictions, with a focus on CBD. Subsequently, this article will evaluate the underlying evidence for CBD as a potential treatment for substance use disorder, across a range of substances including nicotine, alcohol, psychostimulants, opioids, and cannabis. While early research supports CBD's promise, further investigation and validation of CBD's efficacy, across preclinical and clinical trials will be necessary.   \n> <sub>\u2013\u2013 Chye Y et al.: [\"The Endocannabinoid System and Cannabidiol's Promise for the Treatment of Substance Use Disorder\"][2], Front Psychiatry. 2019 Feb 19;10:63. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00063. </sub> \n\n\n> Increased access to medicinal and recreational cannabis will be accompanied by greater exposure to its chemical constituents, including \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the primary nonpsychoactive compound. Increasing attention has focused on CBD, in part, due to its potential therapeutic properties. Relatively little is known about how CBD might interact with other commonly used drugs. While a number of studies have explored the influence of cannabis or \u03949-THC on alcohol consumption and treatment outcomes, few have examined the effects of CBD on alcohol-related outcomes. This article reviews preclinical and human studies examining the effects of CBD administration on alcohol responses. Preliminary preclinical results suggest that CBD can attenuate alcohol consumption and potentially protect against certain harmful effects of alcohol, such as liver and brain damage. Also reviewed herein are the few existing studies involving CBD and alcohol coadministration in humans. The paucity of such studies precludes any definitive conclusions relating to CBD-alcohol interactions. Effects of CBD on alcohol use and potential therapeutic implications for alcohol use disorder are discussed.    \n> <sub>\u2013\u2013 Nona CN et al.: [\"Effects of cannabidiol on alcohol-related outcomes: A review of preclinical and human research\"][3], Exp Clin Psychopharmacol. 2019 May 23. doi: 10.1037/pha0000272.</sub> \n\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \n> There is substantial interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in plants of the genus Cannabis. The goal of the current systematic review was to characterize the existing literature on this topic and to evaluate the credibility of CBD as a candidate pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using a comprehensive search strategy, 303 unique potential articles were identified and 12 ultimately met criteria for inclusion (8 using rodent models, 3 using healthy adult volunteers, and 1 using cell culture). In both rodent and cell culture models, CBD was found to exert a neuroprotective effect against adverse alcohol consequences on the hippocampus. In rodent models, CBD was found to attenuate alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity, specifically, alcohol-induced steatosis. Finally, findings from preclinical rodent models also indicate that CBD attenuates cue-elicited and stress-elicited alcohol-seeking, alcohol self-administration, withdrawal-induced convulsions, and impulsive discounting of delayed rewards. In human studies, CBD was well tolerated and did not interact with the subjective effects of alcohol. Collectively, given its favorable effects on alcohol-related harms and addiction phenotypes in preclinical models, CBD appears to have promise as a candidate AUD pharmacotherapy. This is further bolstered by the absence of abuse liability and its general tolerability. A clear limitation to the literature is the paucity of human investigations. Human preclinical and clinical studies are needed to determine whether these positive effects in model systems substantively translate into clinically-relevant outcomes.    \n> <sub> \u2013\u2013 Turna J et al.: [\"Cannabidiol as a Novel Candidate Alcohol Use Disorder Pharmacotherapy: A Systematic Review\",][4] Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2019 Apr;43(4):550-563. doi: 10.1111/acer.13964.</sub> \n\n\n[Cannabidiol protects liver from binge alcohol-induced steatosis by mechanisms including inhibition of oxidative stress and increase in autophagy.][5]\n\n[Transdermal delivery of cannabidiol attenuates binge alcohol-induced neurodegeneration in a rodent model of an alcohol use disorder.][6]\n\n[Cannabidiol as an Intervention for Addictive Behaviors: A Systematic Review of the Evidence][7]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214036\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837904\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120285\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698831\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398069\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012796\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444130/", "19537": "The currently recognized world record in fasting - by drinking only water and taking multivitamin supplements - is *382 days* by a 27 years old man who went from 207 to 82 kg in this time ([Postgradual Medical Journal, 1973][1], [Wikipedia][2]).

Given that there are relatives of those pathogens that have other patterns of infection, and given how evolution operates more broadly speaking, it is straightforward to say that sexually transmitted infections are caused by *pathogens that evolved from similar species with other patterns of infection/transmission or other host species*.\n\nHIV is a special case in that it's a relatively new STI for humans and its history has been closely studied (see Sharp & Hahn, 2011). Viruses similar to HIV seem to have been in monkeys for a long time, and at some point were transmitted to chimpanzees, probably due to blood contact between chimpanzees and monkeys they were eating, and most likely spread to humans from chimpanzees in the same fashion. Once a human was infected in this fashion, the primary way they spread the infection to other humans was sexually.\n\n**Where do STIs originate from *in a given person* or sexually active couple**\n\nGiven two people who are not infected with STIs, they cannot spread STIs between them through sexual contact: STIs do not originate spontaneously. \n\nHowever, someone who currently does not have an STI can in the future become someone who does have an STI and then spread infection to their partner, primarily *by sexual contact with some third party who is infected*.\n\nIt is possible for sexually transmitted pathogens to also be transmitted in other ways; for example, for several STIs transmission is possible during childbirth, herpes viruses can be transmitted by mouth contact, HIV is transmitted by blood contact such as contaminated blood supplies or reused needles in situations of poor medical practice or illicit drug use (or in the patient zero case described above for HIV, through blood contact of another host). \n\nSomeone infected in any of these ways can then spread the infection to a sexual partner.\n\n---\n\nSharp, P.

The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also much higher in African Americans compared to West Africans\n\n\n>In countries where good health standards do not exist, people are chronically infected by those various pathogens. In those countries, the prevalence of allergic diseases remains low. Interestingly, several countries that have eradicated those common infections see the emergence of allergic and autoimmune diseases. \u00a0[3][1]\n\n\n \n \n \n \n - Proof of principle of the casual relationship between the decline of\n   infectious diseases and an increase of immunological disorders.\n \n \n \n \n - The answer to this question comes from animal models of autoimmune and allergic diseases and, to a lesser degree, from clinical intervention studies.\n \n \n \n - The incidence of spontaneous T1D is directly correlated with the sanitary conditions of the animal facilities, for both the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and the bio-breeding diabetes-prone (BB-DP) rat : **the lower the infectious burden, the higher the disease incidence**\u00a0[3][1]\nOther examples -\n \n \n - infection of NOD mice with a wide variety of bacteria, virus and parasites protects completely (\u2018clean\u2019 NOD mice) from diabetes\u00a0\n \n - mycobacteria (e.g. complete Freund's adjuvant) prevent induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma.\n\n>The decline is particularly clear for hepatitis A (HAV), childhood diarrhoea and perhaps even more spectacular for parasitic diseases such as filariasis, onchocercosis, schistosomiasis or other soil-transmitted helminthiasis.\u00a0[3][1]\n\n>Epidemiological data of cross-sectional studies revealed that Schistosoma infections have a strong protective effect against atopy, as reviewed recently. Hookworms such as\u00a0Necator americanus\u00a0also seem to protect from asthma\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434398/)\n\n \n - Interestingly, it's been thought that, if parasitic infections if decline, then eosinophils which are involved in allergic reactions and parasitic reactions, may in fact have a role in increased allergy.\n(Ref. Robbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases)\n \n - \n> It has been shown that helminth eradication increases atopic skin\nsensitization in Venezuela.\n\u00a0[3][1]\n\n***Mechanism of Hygiene Hypothesis:***\n\u00a0[3][1]\n \n 1. *Th1 to Th2 deviation* - \n \n - Th1 T cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, interferon\n   (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 that are operational in\n   cell-mediated immunity (including autoimmune diabetes).\n\n \n \n \n \n - In contrast, Th2 T cells that produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13\n   contribute to IgE production and allergic responses.\n \n \n \n - IL - 5 most potent eosinophil activating cytokine known. Upon activation, eosinophils liberate proteolytic enzymes as well as two unique proteins called major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein which damage tissue.It is now believed that the late phase reaction is a major cause of symptoms in some type 1 hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma.\n(Ref. Robbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases)\n \n \n \n - \n>IL-4 enhances Th2 differentiation; also promote class switching of B cell to IgE. \nIL-13 enhances IgE production and acts on epithelial cells to stimulate mucus secretion.\n(Ref. Robbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases)\n \n - IgE is involved in Type-1 Hypersensitivity, and hence it increases\nwill increase HST, like allergic asthma. (Ref. Robbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases)\n\n \n  - Given the reciprocal down-regulation of Th1 and Th2 cells, some authors suggested initially that in developed countries the lack of microbial burden in early childhood, which normally favours a strong Th1-biased immunity, redirects the immune response towards a Th2 phenotype and therefore predisposes the host to allergic disorders.\n\n2.*Antigen Competition*\n\n - \n>The development of strong immune responses against antigens from infectious agents could inhibit responses to \u2018weak\u2019 antigens such as autoantigens and allergens.\u00a0\n\n(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828/)\n\n3. *Immunoregulation* \n\n - Regulatory T cells which can suppress immune responses distinct from responses against the antigen in question, here antigens expressed by infectious agents (a phenomenon called bystander suppression)\n\n4.*Non Antigenic Ligand*\n\n \n \n \n - A number of experiments indicate that infectious agents can promote protection from allergic diseases through mechanisms independent of their constitutive antigens, leading to stimulation of non-antigen specific receptors. This concept is well illustrated by the example of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)\n \n \n \n - It has also been observed that TLR stimulation could prevent the onset of spontaneous autoimmune diseases such as T1D in NOD.\n \n \n - Another mechanism of TLR4 is studied,\nwhere a virus (RSV) which is linked with childhood asthma flips the 'switch' of TLR4. Now LPS a bacterial endotoxin also flips the switch but in a different way.\n \n  - When this education is lacking or weak, the response to RSV by some critical cells in the immune system\u2019s defence against infections\u2014called \u201cT-cells\u201d\u2014might inadvertently trigger asthma instead of protecting the infant and clearing the infection. How this happens is a mystery that we are trying to solve.\n(Ref.- https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm167471.htm)\n\n \n \n - Gene-Environment Interaction\n Eg. NOD2 - cytoplasmic sensor of bacteria expressed in Paneth and other intestinal epithelial cells; May control resistance to gut commensal bacteria.\n \n  - Correlation with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. (Ref. Robbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases).\n\n\n*Hygiene during early childhood/pre-natal*\n\n>Graham Rook and colleagues proposed a new explanation for the rise of immune disorders, which Rook called the \u201cold friends\u201d hypothesis. \u201cWe realized human beings coevolved with a whole host of organisms, and it was far more likely what was going on was that we were being deprived of organisms on which we are dependent.\n\n>Maternal microbes colonize the human gut while babies are in utero, and again as they pass through the birth canal and start breastfeeding. Young children continue amassing microbiota in every contact with family members, while playing outside in the dirt, getting licked by dogs, and sharing toys with friends. The developing immune system takes cues from all of these encounters.\n\n\n***Recent Thoughts***\n\n \n \n \n \n \n - To the public, \u201chygiene\u201d is interpreted as personal cleanliness: washing hands, keeping food clean and fresh, sanitizing the home.[2][2]\n \n \n \n \n \n - However, because the hypothesis has been largely uncoupled from infections, the idea that we need to be less hygienic is wrong.\n [2][2]\n \n \n \n - Relaxing hygiene standards would not reverse the trend but only serve to increase the risks of infectious disease, says Bloomfield.\n [2][2]\n \n \n - The second major concern among researchers is a lack of evidence demonstrating how to reduce rates of allergic and autoimmune diseases.\u00a0[2][2]\n \n \n - *Although hygiene hypothesis proposes germ exposure but still diseases like Diabetes and Asthma are multifactorial in origin and hygiene may be playing only a part.*[1][3]\n \n  - Eg. Asthma \n>But preventing asthma isn't as simple as avoiding antibacterial soap, having a big family or spending time on the farm. For one thing, a number of microbes \u2014 such as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \u2014 may cause asthma rather than prevent it. In addition, infections that might help prevent asthma can cause a number of other health problems. The type of germ isn't the only factor that plays a role, either. The severity of infection and when the infection occurs during childhood also appear to matter.\n(Ref. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/expert-answers/hygiene-hypothesis/faq-20058102)\n\nMore research is needed to understand exactly how childhood germ exposure might help prevent asthma. What we do know is that in children with asthma, exposure to germs is likely to do more harm than good.\n\n\n\n\n**Abbreviations**\n\n \n - HAV - hepatitis A Virus\n \n - T1D - type 1 diabetes\n \n - MS- multiple sclerosis\n \n - NOD - non-obese diabetic\n \n - HST - hypersensitivity\n \n - TLR - toll-like receptors\n \n - LPS - lipopolysaccharide\n\n**References**:\n\n 1. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/expert-answers/hygiene-hypothesis/faq-20058102\n 2. https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm167471.htm\n\n\n 3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828/\n\n\n 4. \nRobbins and Cotran- Pathologic basis of diseases\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828\n  [2]: https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm167471.htm\n  [3]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-asthma/expert-answers/hygiene-hypothesis/faq-20058102", "18471": "You're describing an unexpected intra-operative finding. The possibility of unexpected findings (and their treatment) is usually discussed during the consent for the original procedure. Of course, in this situation, there was no initial discussion. The way this sort of issue is usually framed in medical ethics uses a framework of four principles (see Beauchamp and Childress, Principles of Biomedical Ethics): autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Here, beneficence (the best interest of the patient), outweighs autonomy (the right of the patient to make his or her own choice) for the life saving surgery, and the same would need to occur for addressing the unexpected finding. One would have to (intraoperatively) consider the risks and benefits of removing the tumor, as well as the risks of a second operation were the surgeon to defer. In, e.g., a laparotomy, a readily visualized tumor would almost certainly be removed and sent to pathology. Other cases (e.g., neurosurgery, with a tumor involving eloquent cortex), are more complicated. This sort of thing is less common now, given the likelihood of seeing any tumor that would be obvious during surgery ahead of time with high resolution cross sectional imaging, but it does happen. \n\nYou can read a little about the decision making around unexpected intra-operative findings [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23177065), in the context of abdominal surgery.", "18303": "If you have kidney stones or you are at increased risk of developing them, ask a doctor if your urine is super- or under-saturated with any substance, such as calcium, oxalate, uric acid, cystine or citrate; this is a crucial info that can tell if any diet can help. Explanation at-a-glance: [Eating, Diet, & Nutrition for Kidney Stones by NIDDK][1].\n\n**Evidence about dietary measures that may help prevent CALCIUM OXALATE stones:**\n\n**1. High water intake**\n\nAccording to several studies, drinking  3-4 liters of water per day (to produce at least 2 liters of urine/day) can decrease the risk of stones ([PubMed, 1999][2], [2016][3]).\n\nOther fluids, such as tea, coffee, wine and beer *might* also help, but milk, soda and fruit juices *might not,* according to [one 2015 systematic review of studies][4].\n\nIt is not clear if hard water (high in Ca and/or Mg) is a risk factor for kidney stones ([PubMed, 2018][5], [2002][6]).\n\n**2. High citrus/citrates intake**\n\nPotassium citrate supplements and possibly (?) citrus juices ([PubMed 2017][7], [2016][8]), which alkalize the urine, can decrease the risk of stones, but this [2015 Cochrane review][9] does not strongly support this evidence. Additionally, potassium citrate supplements may have a lot of side effects.\n\n**3. High dietary calcium intake**\n\nSurprisingly, high intake of calcium *from foods* was associated with lower risk of kidney stones in several big observational studies. On the other hand, calcium *supplements* may increase the risk. According to [Linus Pauling Institute][10], calcium may inhibit the absorption of oxalate in the intestine and thus its accumulation in the urine.\n\n**4. Low sodium (salt) intake**\n\nLow sodium intake (< 3.8 g salt/day) decreases calcium excretion in the kidneys and thus the risk of stones ([Linus Pauling Institute][11]).\n\n**5. Low oxalate intake**\n\n[Diet low in oxalates][12] can reduce the risk of stones if your urine has too much oxalate ([PubMed, 2016][13]).\n\n**For URATE stones,** apart from above measures, **diet low in animal proteins** can help ([PubMed, 2004][14]).\n\n  [1]: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-stones/eating-diet-nutrition\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9873212\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4831051/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504608/\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934277/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12100915\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428529/\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311217\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439475\n  [10]: https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/calcium#kidney-stones-prevention\n  [11]: https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/sodium\n  [12]: https://www.upmc.com/-/media/upmc/patients-visitors/education/unique-pdfs/low-oxalate-diet.pdf\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114711/\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15493118", "18300": "The relation between TSH and free T4 is bidirectional and complex [1\u20134]. TSH stimulates the secretion of T4 from the thyroid gland. Immediately after being released into the bloodstream the vast majority of T4 is bound to plasma proteins including albumin, thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR, formerly called thyroxine-binding prealbumin or TBPA). Free and bound hormones are in an equilibrium, which is controlled by fast feedback loops. What is effective, however, is the small free portion of T4. It is converted to T3 via different deiodinases in the tissues, and it has some direct effects at integrin receptors on the cell membrane. T3 and especially 3,5-T2 are the more active thyroid hormones that express mainly genomic effects. This also applies to their central actions, which result in a suppression of TSH (and also TRH [5]) release. Additional control motifs include ultrashort feedback of TSH release [6], dual feedback via T4 and T3 [7], and a TSH-T3-shunt, where TSH directly stimulates T3 formation within the thyroid [reviewed in\u00a02]:\n\n[![Overview of thyroid homeostasis [Hoermann et al. 2015]][1]][1]\n\nUnfortunately, there is little empirical information available that is suitable for analysis (to refer to your comment from Dec 25).

In fact, watching shows involving CPR and defibrillation is a source of both amusement and frustration for most medical professionals because it is almost always portrayed wildly inaccurately.\n\nDefibrillation is effective against only ventricular fibrillation (VF or V-Fib, which is when the heart is beating too irregularly for effective blood circulation to occur) and *pulseless* ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-Tach, which is when the heart is beating too fast for effective circulation). Automated defibrillators simply will not shock other rhythms, including asystole (\"flat line\"). No one trained to use a manual defibrillator would do so either.\n\nYes, a defibrillator can definitely stop a beating heart. However, if that heart started out healthy and hasn't been injured, then it's quite likely it will restart on its own due to the [autorhythmicity][1] of cardiac cells. This is why [cardioversion][2] can be used to treat arrhythmias with relative safety. A cardioversion is simply a defibrillation of the heart timed to coincide precisely with a safe point in the heart rhythm. \n\nInterestingly, there was even one case of an [unsuccessful suicide attempt using a defibrillator][3]. Had the nurse followed his training and applied the paddles to his chest instead of his head, he might have succeeded.\n\nAlthough the \"it can't hurt\" logic is tempting, the fact is that inappropriate defibrillation *can* hurt. Defibrillation [works][4] by depolarizing the entire heart, which interrupts the arrhythmia and provides an opportunity for autorhythmicity to restart a normal rhythm. If the patient is in asystole the heart is already depolarized, so defibrillation will accomplish nothing except perhaps depolarizing cells that were in the process of repolarizing, thereby eliminating the already very small chance of restoring a heartbeat. \n\nDefibrillation is also ineffective against pulseless electrical activity ([PEA][5]). In PEA, the heart's conduction system is functioning normally but some other cause is preventing it from pumping blood. Hypovolemia and hypoxemia are the most common causes of PEA. The only effective treatment for PEA is to find and correct the cause.\n\nIf the patient is in some rhythm other than VF or VT, defibrillation may stop their heart, or put them into VF or VT. It simply isn't done no matter what you might see on television.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential#Autorhythmicity\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioversion\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2819293\n  [4]: http://www.aed.com/blog/brief-explanation-defibrillator-really/\n  [5]: https://acls.com/free-resources/knowledge-base/pea-asystole/what-is-pulseless-electrical-activity-pea", "18168": "First, don't hold your 4 year old child upside down when performing abdominal thrusts for choking.\n\nThis is what you (and any bystander) should do for a choking child (Note that intervention for a choking child is appropriate for any individual to perform, though one should obtain consent from a parent if they are there.

Because of this, Autism and Asperger's Disorder was a separate diagnosis under DSM-IV even though Asperger's Disorder is on the lower end of the autistic spectrum.\n\nDSM-5\u00a0redefined the autism spectrum disorders expanding the **umbrella term** to encompass the previous diagnoses of\u00a0autism,\u00a0Asperger syndrome,\u00a0pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\u00a0(PDD-NOS), and\u00a0childhood disintegrative disorder ([APA, 2013][2])\n\n>Using DSM-IV, patients could be diagnosed with four separate disorders: autistic disorder, Asperger\u2019s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, or the catch-all diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Researchers found that these separate diagnoses were not consistently applied across different clinics and treatment centers. Anyone diagnosed with one of the four pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) from DSM-IV should still meet the criteria for ASD in DSM-5 or another, more accurate DSM-5 diagnosis. While DSM does not outline recommended treatment and services for mental disorders, determining an accurate diagnosis is a first step for a clinician in defining a treatment plan for a patient.\n>\nThe Neurodevelopmental Work Group, led by Susan Swedo, MD ([Swedo, et al. 2012][4]), senior investigator at the National Institute of Mental Health, recommended the DSM-5 criteria for ASD to be a better reflection of the state of knowledge about autism. The Work Group believes a single umbrella disorder will improve the diagnosis of ASD without limiting the sensitivity of the criteria, or substantially changing the number of children being diagnosed. \n\n##References\n\nAPA (2013) *Autism Spectrum Disorder Fact Sheet*.

This may have involved direct contact with saliva or neural tissue. There is a fascinating [1962 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13880956), in response to these reports, that suggests transmission to animals without direct contact with the bats. A more recent [study](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/195/8/1144/816583) also demonstrated aerosol transmission between animals. This type of transmission seems to require a very particular environment and a large dose of virus.\n\n### In summary\nGenerally you need **direct exposure to an animal** for it to be considered an infectious exposure. There are very rare reports of two other types of exposure described above. If, somehow, you have a large, still wet sample of saliva or CSF from a rabid animal laying on soil, grass, or leaves, though, there may be viable virus. Rabies is not particularly hardy, and difficult to maintain in culture.

Alternative treatments, such as **gallstone dissolution** with ursodeoxycholic acid is effective only for **small gallstones (<0.5 cm);** also, after discontinuation of treatment, the stones often reappear ([Emedicine][1]).\n 2. Making a cut in the gallbladder and removing gallstones is a major risk for a serious abdominal infection (peritonitis), which can occur even after gallbladder removal ([PubMed][2]). This is especially critical in **acute gallbladder inflammation.**\n 3. **Chronic gallbladder inflammation** can cause pain and gallbladder removal is pretty much the only known treatment ([MedlinePlus][3]).\n 4. To effectively treat **gallbladder cancer,** you typically need to remove some tissue around it (safe margin) and this is most reliably done by removing the gallbladder.\n\nIt is true that about 1/3 of people, after gallbladder removal, will have long-term problems with diarrhea, but this is due to irritation by large amounts of bile that constantly flows from the liver to the intestine and not due to fat maldigestion ([Mayo Clinic][4]). Many people will have no symptoms.\n\nIf the origin of pain is in the gallbladder, the pain should disappear after gallbladder removal. The pain that persists after the removal usually arises from the *bile ducts* that stay in the body, for example, due to stones in the bile ducts or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\n\nIn elderly or severely ill individuals, who are not fit enough to undergo gallbladder removal, drainage of the gallbladder can be performed as a palliative measure with a temporary effect ([PubMed Health][5]). \n\n\n  [1]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/175667-treatment#showall\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3464996/\n  [3]: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000217.htm\n  [4]: https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cholecystectomy/expert-answers/gallbladder-removal/faq-20058481\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0058062/", "17453": "I'm not clear why you're asking this as this information is readily available unless I missed something in your question.\n\nAs for anticoagulant activity, my recollection is that if anything Ibuprofen is one of the worse NSAIDs in terms of [cardiovascular side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422108/) being prothrombotic, though not as bad as Diclofenac.\n\n[![ibuprofen mode of action][1]][1]\n\n> The main mechanism of action of ibuprofen is the non-selective, reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2 (coded for by PTGS1 and PTGS2, respectively).\n\n...\n\n> Ibuprofen exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects through inhibition of both COX isoforms. In addition, ibuprofen scavenges HO . radical, . NO and ONOO - and can potentiate or inhibit nitric oxide formation through its effects on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. Ibuprofen may activate anti-nociceptive axis through binding to the cannabinoid receptors and through inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that metabolizes endocannabinoid anandamide.\n\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7SDv0.png\n\nThe supplementary question is, **why is that NSAIDs also don't have anti-coagulant effect?**.  And the answer is that they do but it is short lived and reversible as the drug concentration falls, where aspirin's effect is irreversible.\n\n> All conventional, non-COX selective NSAIDs, also block platelets by inhibiting thromboxane synthesis but in contrast to aspirin, this effect is reversible. This is why an NSAID is not a satisfactory substitute for low-dose aspirin as a prophylactic therapy for cardiovascular events. As the blood concentration of the NSAID declines, the effect on the platelets also declines and is lost. This loss of platelet inhibitory effect is more pronounced for NSAIDs with shorter half-lives in the body such as ibuprofen, where for significant parts of the 24 hour day, platelets will not be inhibited. This problem is compounded if compliance with the NSAID is not perfect.\n>\n> There is one other important complication. This effect of aspirin is blocked by concomitant therapy with all non-selective, conventional NSAIDs, except for diclofenac. (2) Also, we now know that the non-selective, conventional NSAIDs also increase the risk of cardiovascular events occurring. Diclofenac happens to be the most risky of the non-selective NSAIDs, and approximately equivalent to available COX-II selective NSAIDs such as celecoxib.

The toxic interaction could occur not only from drinking caffeinated beverages while taking the painkiller but also from using large amounts of medications that intentionally combine caffeine and acetaminophen for the treatment of migraine headaches, menstrual discomfort and other conditions, the researchers say.\n\nThis was a very preliminary study using genetically modified bacteria\n\n>  Chemist Sid Nelson, Ph.D., and colleagues, of the University of Washington in Seattle, tested the effects of acetaminophen and caffeine on E. coli bacteria genetically engineered to express a key human enzyme in the liver that detoxifies many prescription and nonprescription drugs. The researchers found that caffeine triples the amount of a toxic byproduct, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), that the enzyme produces while breaking down acetaminophen. This same toxin is responsible for liver damage and failure in toxic alcohol-acetaminophen interactions, they say.\n>\n> In previous studies, the same researchers showed that high doses of caffeine can increase the severity of liver damage in rats with acetaminophen-induced liver damage, thus supporting the current finding.\n\nBut crucially the bacteria were exposed to megadoses of both acetaminophen and caffeine.\n\nNow, caffeine is regularly provided in combination with acetaminophen in some analgesic compounds despite this ancient warning.\n\nThe latest data from 2017 I can find suggests that the interaction in humans is somewhat less dramatic, and caffeine may even help reduce acetaminophen toxicity!\n\n>  In conclusion, the impact of CAF on APAP\u2010induced hepatotoxicity was here investigated in humans by simultaneously considering drug effects of CAF on APAP at both the PK and the PD level. It was shown that CAF has a significant effect on APAP\u2010induced hepatotoxicity due to a co\u2010administration of both drugs. Key results demonstrate, on the one hand, that CAF might favor a reduction of APAP\u2010induced hepatotoxicity in humans at the PK and the PD levels by reducing the concentrations of NAPQI, which is supposed to be the reactive metabolite of APAP,2 as well as by positively regulating genes playing an essential role in the development of toxicity, respectively. On the other hand, CAF might also potentiate APAP\u2010induced toxicity by affecting crucial genes, such as FOS, that may support the activation of cell death pathways. Although key outcomes of the study demonstrated inhibitory and stimulatory effects of CAF on APAP, the question if CAF potentiates or diminishes the hepatotoxicity caused by extensive exposure of APAP partly remains open.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the risk of harm from an energy drink after ingestion of 1G of acetaminophen is close to nil.\n\nAs for the maximum dose of acetaminophen, in adults this is 1G q4 - q6 hourly to a maximum of 4G and not 2G as mentioned in the other answer.  The makers of Tylenol have suggested that this be reduced to 3G since people often combine analgesics without realizing that the other product might also contain acetaminophen, but this doesn't change the fact that the safe dose from all sources remains 4G daily.\n\n1. https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2007/september/news-release-mixing-large-doses-of-both-acetaminophen-painkiller-and-caffeine-may-increase-risk-of-liver-damage.html\n\n2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321810/\n\n\n3. https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/acetaminophen-safety-be-cautious-but-not-afraid", "15273": "Some vendors publish the pH values for the products they sell ([examples in this answer][1]). But that seems to be only the case if their product really stands out to the competition with high pH levels. Simple carbonated water (de-ionised) can have quite a low pH but other factors come into play for the acidity of the finished item. \n\nThis brand's website has a section on this:\n\n> [**What is the PH balance of LaCroix waters?**][2]\n\n> <sub>The pH level of LaCroix varies by flavor and is less acidic than traditional soft drinks, 100% juice and juice drinks, and other typical beverages without the calories! If there are any concerns about your acidity consumption, please consult your physician.</sub>\n\n> <sub>Dr. Matthew Messina, a dentist and spokesperson for the American Dental Association, told MUNCHIES, a website and digital video channel, that \u201cthe health risks of sugarless, naturally carbonated waters like La Croix and Perrier are nowhere near those of sugary sodas, despite their textural similarities. There is no scientific evidence that sparkling waters are any more dangerous or damaging to the teeth than regular water.\u201d</sub>\n\nReal answer: \"What the hell, we won't tell!\"\n\nOf course, the real pH depends not only on the other salts in the water but on what exactly is used for flavouring it. If it is citric acid for example, and all too often it is, then chances for a drink low in acidity dwindle fast.\n\n> [**This Is Why You Should Stop Drinking LaCroix**][3] \n> [**Flavored waters \u2014 yes, including La Croix \u2014 are eroding your teeth** (2017)][4]\n\nIt is really a pity and disgrace that \"sparkling water\" often refers to acidified flavoured sparkling water. Regarding dental health these are quite different.\n\n\n> [**Why flavored waters are bad for your teeth ** (2017)][5]\n> Carbonating that (which is adding carbonic acid) lowers its pH to about 5. (Happily, that is well in the tooth-safe zone, so you can go ahead and drink your plain sparkling water without worry.) The trouble starts when flavors are added, and the citric acid commonly used in bottled flavored waters is considered especially insidious because besides lowering pH it also may remove calcium from the teeth. A 2016 report published in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that un-carbonated flavored waters such as grape, lemon or strawberry Dasani had a pH of 3, only somewhat better than RC Cola and Coca-Cola, which were among the most acidic tested, at 2.32 and 2.37 respectively (and which are close to the pH 2.25 of pure lemon juice). On its website, the brand Hint says the pH of its waters range from 3.5 to 4.\n\n\nNot only single expert opinions support this view. Some studies that support the \n\n> [**Investigation of mineral waters and soft drinks in relation to dental erosion.** (2001)][6]\n\n> [**The erosive potential of flavoured sparkling water drinks** (2007)][7]\n> **Conclusions:**\u2002 Flavoured sparkling waters should be considered as potentially erosive, and preventive advice on their consumption should recognize them as potentially acidic drinks rather than water with flavouring.\n> [![Apaptite dissolution capacity][8]][8]\n> <sub>Mean hydroxyapatite dissolution and standard deviation, expressed as the theoretical mass of phosphate (\u03bcg) present in 1.5 mL of test solution, both after the immediate opening of the test liquid and after 30 min of exposure of the carbonated water to air. Each value is based on the average of 10 replicate samples.</sub>\n\n\nThat has to be put into perspective. Even citric acid is not the devil. The pH is not everything. Amount of drink you consume and exposure time to your teeth are much more meaningful and harder to measure but better controllable than this easy to measure but harder to control number that is pH. \n\n> [**The effects of beverages on plaque acidogenicity after a sugary challenge** (2013)][9]\n\n\nCompanies adding needlessly such superfluous ingredients like citric or other acids to \"sparkling water\" should be held responsible for diluting the meaning of that term and sued if they continue to sell this with a misleading claim like \"healthy\", since all around these flavoured waters are apparently not tooth friendly.  Not drinking them might be one sane option. \n\nInsisting to ingest might warrant the following precautionary measures: \n\nCopied from the Chicago Tribune article:\n\n> - Don't use it as your primary hydration  \n- Minimize time exposure\n- Drink it with a meal or snack\n- Don't be a swisher\n\n\n\nThe company does not release pH levels for its products. Given the question's interest in lime, lemon it is quite reasonable to assume a significant amount of citric acid used or the \"flavour\". This will bring down the pH-level to significantly lower than real, unflavoured water.  If it does not contain citric acid or similar compounds under the label of so-called \"flavour\" then another indicator is the fact that it does not contain any sodium. The less minerals such a water contains, the more pronounced the resulting pH from the added carbonic acid. Let me be bold and cast an educated guess: the pH level will be well below 4.\n\nFor comparison some of these \"water\" drinks were classified as such:\n\n> [**The pH of beverages in the United States** (2015):][10]  \n> This comprehensive pH assessment of commercially available beverages in the United States found that most are potentially erosive to the dentition.  \n    \n>  Erosive ___________________________________ pH   \n> Activ Water Power Strawberry Kiwi _____________ 3.38     \n> Clear American (flavored water) Kiwi Strawberry __ 3.70    \n> Skinny Water Acai Grape Blueberry ____________ 3.81    \n> Sobe Life Water Acai Fruit Punch ______________ 3.22         \n> Vitamin Water Connect Black Cherry-Lime _______ 2.96\n\nAs long as the company decides to keep silent about the ingredients and the FDA continues to allow them this practice:\n\n>  [What's actually in this stuff? And why is it so incredibly addicting?][11]\n\n> Part of the problem is that there's actually no way to know for sure what gives this very subtly flavored drink its ambiguous \"essence.\" Look at a LaCroix can and you'll see it has no artificial sweeteners, no calories, no sodium, no nothing. The only two ingredients are carbonated water and natural flavor, which means almost nothing. Carbonated water is water with CO2 in it. Sure, it creates a little carbonic acid in the drink, which some folks have said could harm your teeth, but so long as you're healthy your saliva easily neutralizes those acids. It's the second ingredient\u2014natural flavor\u2014that holds the key to LaCroix's allure.\n\n> According to the FDA, natural flavor can be anything that adds flavor to a product so long as it comes directly from a plant or animal source. That's a pretty wide range, but it's further muddled by the fact that natural flavors can be made up of more than one ingredient\u2014including artificial ingredients that help preserve the flavor or help it mix well with the other ingredients. \"You see 'natural flavor' on a label and it's really a black box of secrecy in terms of what's being added to that product,\" says David Andrews, a chemist from the Environmental Working Group.\n\n> Just like their artificial counterparts, natural flavors are complex chemical formulas invented by food companies and a small handful of flavor houses around the world. The FDA lets companies call these formulas natural even if they have synthetic solvents or preservatives because it classifies those filler ingredients as \"incidental additives,\" which usually come in trace amounts and get a pass from ingredient disclosure laws.\n\n> Before you start panic-counting the gallons of LaCroix you've consumed in the last two days alone, know that National Beverage, the obscure Florida-based company that owns LaCroix, claims that it doesn't add anything artificial to its flavors. Instead, they use \"natural essence oils ... extracted from the named fruit used in each of our LaCroix flavors,\" a company spokeswoman said in an email.\n\n> [The skinny on sparkling water: Does it erode teeth?][12]   \n> [Is Carbonated Water Bad for Your Teeth?][13] (Has some further measurements on pH levels.) \n\n\n  [1]: https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13623/11231\n  [2]: http://www.lacroixwater.com/nutritional-faqs/\n  [3]: http://www.eatthis.com/la-croix-healthy/\n  [4]: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-flavored-water-effects-on-teeth20170427-story.html\n  [5]: http://www.leesimondds.com/dental-news-and-updates/why-flavored-waters-are-bad-for-your-teeth\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556958\n  [7]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-263X.2006.00784.x/abstract\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4NVL.png\n  [9]: http://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(14)60548-1/fulltext\n  [10]: http://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(15)01050-8/pdf\n  [11]: https://www.wired.com/2016/12/heres-lacroix-addictive/\n  [12]: http://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/2016/03/the-skinny-on-sparkling-water-does-it-erode-teeth.html\n  [13]: https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-and-nutrition-quackery/carbonated-water-bad-your-teeth", "15170": "I presume she is at risk for developing bowel malignancy at some time in the future.

There was no evidence of an effect on asymptomatic influenza or on non-influenza, influenza-like illness, but **trial conduct problems prevent any definitive conclusion.**\"\n\nSome examples for serious problems in the 'research' conducted:\n\n> [**Oseltamivir and zanamivir have limited effect on symptoms and do not reduce hospitalisation or serious complications of influenza**][7] (Evidence Based Medicine December 2014, 19, 6)<br>\n> The authors identified 20 CTRs of oseltamivir with 9623 participants, and 26 CTRs of zanamivir with 14 628 participants; **many of these studies were never published. The exhaustive review of regulatory documents uncovered some important and previously unknown threats to validity of these clinical trials.** For example, in 11 of 20 oseltamivir trials, the placebo and active drug capsules were not identical, while ascertainment and reporting of complications and hospitalisations was inconsistent or incomplete in many trials, and participants who did not complete the trials did not receive any of the $300 payment for participation, a failure which constitutes an ethical breach.<br>\n**Regarding symptom duration, they found only a modest reduction in symptom duration** (0.6 days for zanamivir and 0.7 days for oseltamivir), less than that described in the published reports. **Oseltamivir did not reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation** (risk difference (RD)=0.07%, 95% CI \u22120.78% to 0.44%), an outcome not reported in the zanamivir trials.<br>\nNo difference was found in the likelihood of serious complications with either drug. While a small reduction in the likelihood of pneumonia was seen in six studies with 2316 patients (RD=1.0%, 95% CI 0.2% to 1.49%), the diagnosis was not radiographically confirmed, was inconsist- ently defined and relied on self-report by the patient or physician, mediated by the trialists. Nausea (RD=3.7%, 95% CI 0.9% to 7.4%) and vomiting (RD=4.6%, 95% CI 2.4% to 7.6%) were more common in adults receiving oseltamivir. This was also seen in children with oseltamivir, but not with zanamivir. Both drugs were found to be effective for prophylaxis of influenza, with a number needed to treat of 33 for oseltamivir and 51 for zanamivir.\n\nThe publication bias displayed here alone should be grounds to seriously doubt the findings in relation to this drugs over all.\n\n\n> [**Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children**][8] (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2014, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD008965. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4.)\nOseltamivir and zanamivir **have small, non-specific effects on reducing the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults, but not in asthmatic children.** Using either drug as prophylaxis reduces the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Treatment trials with oseltamivir or zanamivir do not settle the question of whether the complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) are reduced, because of a lack of diagnostic definitions. The use of oseltamivir increases the risk of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal events in adults and vomiting in children. The lower bioavailability may explain the lower toxicity of zanamivir compared to oseltamivir. The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about use of both NIs for either the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. **The influenza virus-specific mechanism of action proposed by the producers does not fit the clinical evidence.**\n\nThere are some known problems regarding the general efficacy of this drugs, which are the result of improper conduct in science and marketing on behalf of the manufacturer:\n\n> [**Oseltamivir: over 15 years of data retention and systematic stonewalling**][9] (Prescrire International February 2016/Volume 25 n\u00b0 168 \u2022 Page 55)<br>\nIn summary. Over a 15-year period, Roche, the company that markets Tamiflu\u00b0, has hampered independent analysis of the assessment data on oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. Worse yet, drug regulators and international organisations have been complicit in this data retention.<br>\nThese 15 years of stonewalling represent a lost opportunity for patients and the medical community, while providing the company with an unfair advantage after successfully bringing oseltamivir to the market on the basis of unverified data. Yet, despite the widespread belief in the efficacy of oseltamivir, cleverly orchestrated by the company and other organisations, including some regulatory and health authorities, a number of independent teams were not convinced and instead went on a hunt for missing data. What they discovered was that the available trial results were neither complete nor clinically relevant and pro- vided only weak evidence. Furthermore, they revealed that the company had not provided the information theoretically required to obtain marketing authorisation.<br>\nFrom the company\u2019s point of view, this deception was a success. Once health authorities and health professionals had been convinced that oseltamivir was effective on influenza, each new assessment that came to a dissenting or unfavourable conclusion could be countered by publication of a new company-funded analysis. This widely used strategy is called a \u201cpublication plan\u201d (17).\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above reasoning a working drug, an effective drug will prevent outbreaks of symptoms as described. But Oseltamivir seems to be not very efficacious in this regard. The small effect, *if any*, this drug may present seems to be in relation to the side effects more in the not worth it drawer than anything else.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-exposure_prophylaxis\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-exposure_prophylaxis\n  [3]: https://www.acfp.ca/wp-content/uploads/tools-for-practice/1480629543_tfp176influenzapepfv2.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15337401\n  [5]: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Merkblaetter/Ratgeber_Influenza_saisonal.html\n  [6]: http://www.npojip.org/english/MedCheck/Med%20Check-TIP%2004-04-05.pdf\n  [7]: http://ebm.bmj.com/content/19/6/211#\n  [8]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4/full\n  [9]: http://english.prescrire.org/en/81/168/51679/0/NewsDetails.aspx", "14748": "[Nicotine withdrawal][1] can cause insomnia rather then oversleeping.\n>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) reports 7 primary symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal: irritability/anger/frustration, anxiety, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, insomnia, and restlessness\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542051/", "14690": "Thank you for the very interesting question regarding the prostate. Let me first briefly explain a few historical confusions regarding the nomenclature of prostatic disorders with particular attention to your \u2018***congestive prostatitis***\u2019, which may be called an almost extinct creature!\n\n\nClassifications of Prostatic Disorders\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[Meares and Stamey (1968)][1] suggested a classification of prostatic disorders based on clinical and bacterial culture findings, and their classification had been widely used at least until 1995. [Doble (1994)][2] identified **Meares and Stamey\u2019s  traditional classification of prostatic disorders** as:\n\n\n> 1.\t       Acute prostatitis \n> 2.\tChronic bacterial prostatitis \n> 3.\tNon-bacterial prostatitis \n> 4.\tProstatodynia\n\n\n\nIn the traditional classification, non-bacterial prostatitis refers to a condition that presents with similar clinical features as chronic bacterial prostatitis, including pyuria, but except that the cultures of urine and expressed prostatic secretions are negative. Prostatodynia also presents with similar clinical features as chronic bacterial prostatitis but excluding pyuria, and the cultures are negative. It is important to note that prostatodynia is more a symptom than a condition itself. \n\nAs noted by [Krieger, Nyberg & Nickel (1999)][3], the US **National Institute of Health (NIH)** standardised the classification of prostatic disorders in 1995 by adding a disease entity as asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, and combining non-bacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia into an entity as chronic prostatitis/pelvic pain syndrome. Thus, the NIH classifications can be listed as:\n\n> \n>  **I.**\tAcute Prostatitis \n> \n>  **II.**\tChronic bacterial prostatitis  \n> \n>  **III A.** Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome,\n> inflammatory \n> \n>  **III B.** Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome,\n> non-inflammatory \n> \n>  **IV.**\tAsymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nHistorical Relationship between Congestive Prostatitis & Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCongestive prostatitis is an outdated nomenclature for a constellation of mostly ill-defined urological and pain symptoms,  and a few signs; it had been a poorly understood entity for the most of its time in use. Congestive prostatitis is clinically characterised by urological symptoms, such as urinary frequency, dysuria, and strangury; and pain or discomfort in urogenital and anal areas, such as pain in the inguinal region radiating sometimes even to the testicles, burning in the urethra, and pressure in the perianal region ([Diederichs, 1988][4]). It is not clear whether the patients experience an actual pain or just a discomfort. According to [G\u00fcnthert (1983)][5], as mentioned by, [Diederichs (1988)][4], many patients, without being asked, stress the fact that they do not experience actual pain, but rather a very unpleasant, disturbing feeling. Some of them cannot even sit comfortably. According to [G\u00fcnthert (1983)][5] and [Janssen et al. (1983) ][1]as mentioned by [Diederichs (1988)][4], over 50% of these patients also complain about sexual disorders, such as erection difficulties, or painful or premature ejaculation. \n\nPoorly defined symptomatology and pathophysiology of congestive prostatitis, along with a host of associated psychological manifestations, either as aetiology or as sequelae, had tempted many to classify congestive prostatitis as a psychosomatic clinical condition in which urological examination may show an actual swelling of the prostate, but where neither bacteria in the expressed prostatic secretions nor any other organic disease can be found ([Janssen et al., 1983][1]; [Diederichs, 1988][4]; [Pavone-Macaluso, di Trapani & Pavone, 1991][2]).\n\nAs mentioned initially, congestive prostatitis is an outdated name for the condition it refers to, and there had been a myriad of names used synonymously to the same condition, perhaps reflecting the poor understanding of the condition itself: **prostatosis, chronic prostatitis, prostate congestion, chronic congestive prostatitis, prostate neurosis, urogenital neurosis, autonomic urogenital syndrome, chronic recurrent prostatitis, and abacterial prostatitis** ([Peterson, 1985][6]; [Diederichs, 1988][4]). \n\nConsidering the current understanding of the pathophysiology and aetiology that ranges from prostatic to extraprostatic causes, diverse nature of the symptomatology, therapeutic options available, and the need to facilitate research with a consistent nomenclature, ***the condition previously called as congestive prostatitis (and the other names mentioned above) is now included in the broad entity called chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)***. **The use of the other names is discouraged to minimise the confusions and ensure consistency in medical literature.** Terms such as congestive prostatitis, congested prostate, and prostate congestion *should only be used, if unavoidable, to describe a particular state or condition of the prostate rather than disease entities themselves*. \n\nChronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a clinical syndrome described based on urological symptoms and/or,  pain or discomfort. It is defined as chronic pelvic pain for at least three of the proceeding six months in the absence of other identifiable aetiologies. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory sub-classification is done on the presence or absence of inflammatory cells in expressed prostatic secretions, post-prostate massage urine, or seminal fluid ([Nickel, Nyberg & Hennenfent, 1999][7]; [Schneider et al., 2005][8]).\n\nIn this discussion, the name \u2018*congestive prostatitis*\u2019 will be used only for the sake of answering the original question. Let us now look into the queries that the original question asks about.\n\n**1. Is there any cure apart from ejaculation?**\n\n**2. Can the condition be improved/helped by,**\n\n**\u2022\tExercise?**\n\n**\u2022\tDietary modifications?**\n\nAs we have discussed above, '*Congestive Prostatitis*' is an outdated name for the vague disease entity it refers to, and the name should be and is avoided in current medical literature. The term congestive prostatitis itself signifies only a state or condition of the prostate rather than a distinct disease entity itself. ***Whatever constellation of symptoms and signs attributed to congestive prostatitis in the past is now classified and named as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)***. \n\nAlthough CP/CPPS still remains a poorly understood disease entity, as reflected by the many hypotheses of its cause, there have been tremendous improvements in its evaluation, diagnosis, and management ([Schneider et al., 2005][8]). The symptoms seem to have a multifactorial origin so it is very important, yet difficult, to exclude underlying diseases with similar symptoms. The identification of the origin of the symptoms is crucial for the effective management; therefore, various attempts have been made to formulate tools to facilitate the evaluation and diagnosis of CP/CPPS,  such as **[NIH-CPSI][9]**, **[I-PSS][10]**, and **[UPOINT][11]** ([Nickel & Shoskes, 2010][12]). \n\nBecause of the multifactorial origin of CP/CPPS, there are a number of therapeutic modalities for CP/CPPS. However, **there is no universally a accepted treatment regime. In fact, none of the therapeutic options hitherto available is a cure for CP/CPPS.** However, many medications and other forms of treatment can help to alleviate the symptoms and make CP/CPPS more bearable. Over time, this condition may improve or stabilise on its own ([Watson, 2017][13]). Few guidelines have been published based on clinical evidence to provide recommendations for the treatment, eg **[The Prostatitis Expert Reference Group (PERG) consensus guideline][14]**, **[Canadian Urological Association (CUA) guideline][15]**. \n\nAlthough this answer is not intended for a detail discussion on each treatment option available, the overall treatment strategies can be outlined as follows:\n\n<br>\n\n1. Pharmacological treatments \u2013\n-------------------------------\n\nAlpha-blockers (eg tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and silodosin), antibiotics (eg ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin), and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (eg finasteride)  are the most efficacious medications for CP/CPPS, provided with they are used judicially considering the nature of individual cases. Anti-inflammatory medication treatment, such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (eg celecoxib) and glucocorticoids (eg prednisolone), are generally given when pain is not controlled with initial therapy. \n\nThe clinical significance of pharmacological treatment for CP/CPPS has been questioned ([Anothaisintawee et al., 2011][16]; [Cohen et al., 2012][17]). **PEGR** recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence:\n\n\n> \u2022\t\u03b1\u2010adrenergic antagonists may have a modest treatment effect\n> regarding total, urinary symptom, pain and QoL scores in CBP and\n> CP/CPPS, and should be considered as an initial treatment option\n> (**Level 1**).\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \u2022\tAntimicrobial therapy may have a moderate effect on total, urinary,\n> pain and QoL scores in CBP and CP/CPPS and should be considered as an\n> initial treatment option (**Level 1**). \n> \n>  \u2022\tThere is insufficient evidence to warrant recommending 5\u03b1\u2010reductase\n> inhibitors as monotherapy in CP/CPPS, unless co\u2010existing BPE is\n> present (**Level 2**). \n> \n>  \u2022\tIn patients with early\u2010stage disease who present with pain\n> symptoms, regular paracetamol may be offered. NSAIDs should be offered\n> only for short\u2010term treatment of pain, to patients with early\u2010stage\n> CBP or CP/CPPS whose symptoms are suspected to be due to an\n> inflammatory process, or those judged to be experiencing an\n> inflammatory flare. If pain is considered to be neuropathic in origin,\n> treatment with a gabapentinoid (e.g. pregabalin or gabapentin), a\n> tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. amitriptyline, nortriptyline or\n> trimipramine) or a selective serotonin\u2010noradrenaline (known in the USA\n> as norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; e.g. duloxetine) is\n> warranted (**Level 5**). \n> \n>  \u2022\tMultimodal/combined therapy should be uniquely designed for each\n> individual patient, according to history, physical examination and\n> investigations. Depending on the symptoms at presentation, the\n> following may be considered for adding to first\u2010line antibiotic\n> therapy (**Level 5**).\n> \n>  o\tAn \u03b1\u2010blocker and/or an NSAID.\n> \n>  o\tAn agent targeting neuropathic pain (e.g. pregabalin).\n> \n>  o\tA 5\u03b1\u2010reductase inhibitor (predominantly for patients with\n> coexisting LUTS with BPE).\n\n\n<br>\n2. Invasive treatments and other non-pharmacological treatments \u2013\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n In some cases of refractory CP/CPPS, invasive surgical treatments such as prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transrectal high\u2010intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the prostate, and transurethral microwave thermotherapy have been used. The evidence on such invasive surgical management techniques is very limited. \n\nOther non-pharmacological treatments such as repetitive prostatic massage, therapeutic ejaculation,  neuromodulation techniques ([Kabay et al., 2009][18]), and various phytotherapies, including pollen extracts, bioflavonoids and/or Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), have been reported as being successful in treating some cases of CP/CPPS. \n\nPhysical dysfunction, such as abnormal pelvic muscle spasm and muscle tenderness, is associated with some cases of CP/CPPS ([Hetrick et al., 2003][19]; [Shoskes et al., 2008][20]). ***Therefore, specialist physiotherapy that aim to improve relaxation and coordinated use of the pelvic floor muscles, such as biofeedback physical therapy and pelvic floor re\u2010education, as well as myofascial trigger point release, may play a role in providing symptom improvement in patients with CP/CPPS. However, the evidence on such treatments is also scarce.*** \n\n**PEGR** recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence:\n\n> \n>  \u2022\tThere is insufficient evidence to warrant recommending surgical\n> techniques, including radical prostatectomy, TURP, HIFU or prostatic\n> massage for the treatment of CBP or CP/CPPS, except in the context of\n> a clinical trial setting (**Level 3**). \n> \n>  \u2022\tThe following specialist physiotherapy treatment options may be\n> considered: pelvic floor re\u2010education; local pelvic floor relaxation;\n> biofeedback; general relaxation; deep relaxation/mindfulness; trigger\n> point release; myofascial release; stretches; exercise for pain\n> management; TENS; acupuncture for trigger point release and pain\n> management; bladder retraining (**Level 5**). \n> \n>  \u2022\tPhytotherapy has a modest beneficial effect on symptom improvement\n> in CBP and CP/CPPS and may be considered as a treatment option in\n> treatment\u2010refractory patients (**Level 2**).\n\n\n***Since the original question mentions \u2018ejaculation\u2019 specifically, a brief historical note is made here. According to [Christoffel (1944)][21] as cited by [Diederichs (1988)][4], the [Confessions][22] of Jean Jacques Rousseau (1767) reveals that Rousseau was plagued by the frequent urge to urinate, which disappeared after a visit to a Venetian brothel but reappeared in connection with hypochondriac fears of having a venereal disease. \nThe role of frequent ejaculation in either producing or reducing CPPS symptoms remains controversial. Although patients with enlarged, symptomatically congested prostate glands are often advised that regular sexual intercourse may alleviate their symptoms, the role of frequent ejaculation in either producing or reducing CP/CPPS symptoms remains controversial, and there is little objective evidence if at all ([Ahuja, 2016][23]; [Watson, 2017][13]).*** \n\n<br>\n\n3. Psychological interventions \u2013\n--------------------------------\n\nCP/CPPS is associated with a host of psychological manifestations, either as aetiology or as sequelae. Accordingly, various psychological treatment modalities have been used to treat CP/CPPS. However, no evidence from randomised clinical trials or comparative studies is available to support the use of psychological treatment or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in these settings. When referring a patient for psychological treatment, it is important to reassure the patient that his condition is real and that his suffering is not imaginary. Psychological support is appropriate in helping the patient cope more effectively with his serious, real-life problem ([Watson, 2017][13]). \n\n**PEGR** recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence:\n\n\n> \u2022\tPsychosocial symptoms should be assessed in both the early and late\n> stages of CBP and CP/CPPS. If there is a significant suspicion of\n> psychological factors contributing to a patient's condition, these\n> should be screened for (**Level 5**).\n> \n>  \u2022\tCBT should be considered in conjunction with other treatments in\n> later\u2010stage CBP and CP/CPPS, as it may improve pain and QoL (**Level 5**).\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n4. Dietary and lifestyle interventions \u2013\n----------------------------------------\n\n***Traditionally, patients have been warned to avoid excessive intake of prostate irritants, such as tobacco (smoking), coffee, tea, caffeine, carbonated drinks, spicy foods, acidic foods, cranberry juice/cranberries, lemon juice, alcohol, and chocolate. However, none of these items is known to cause actual physical damage or to worsen the long-term prognosis. The reported success of this approach is anecdotal, and it will not work for all patients. Nevertheless, responsible limitation of these items may help to control the day-to-day symptoms ([Herati et al., 2013][24]; [Ahuja, 2016][23]; [Watson, 2017][13]). A glass or two of wine or sherry may lessen nocturia symptoms. Alkalinisation of the urine seems to help some patients  ([Watson, 2017][13]).*** \n\nThe benefits of frequent ejaculation and specific exercises have been discussed above. Sitz baths may provide partial relief from acute exacerbations. Perianal self-massage may also also offer some relief, but the reported success is anecdotal ([Ahuja, 2016][23]; [Watson, 2017][13]). Sedentary lifestyle is associated with severe pain in patients with CP/CPPS; therefore, the modification of such lifestyle is a potential target for treatment ([Chen et al., 2016][25]). \n \t\n\n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/23996298?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1785024?dopt=Abstract\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10422990\n  [4]: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-73412-0_9\n  [5]: https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Prostatitis%20aus%20psychosomatischer%20Sicht&author=EA.%20G\u00fcnthert&publication_year=1983\n  [6]: http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA3896974&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=fulltext&issn=0031305X&p=AONE&sw=w&authCount=1&isAnonymousEntry=true\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10443716\n  [8]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05373.x/full\n  [9]: http://www.upointmd.com/NIHCPSIEnglish.pdf\n  [10]: http://www.urospec.com/uro/Forms/ipss.pdf\n  [11]: http://www.upointmd.com\n  [12]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09701.x/asset/j.1464-410X.2010.09701.x.pdf?v=1&t=jb5dofqr&s=3dbe2cd4dd1c308104e815a489f4d2050beb1408\n  [13]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/437745-overview\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008168/#!po=1.04167\n  [15]: https://www.cua.org/themes/web/assets/files/guidelines/en/1121__1_.pdf\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205969\n  [17]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22870266\n  [18]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19641356\n  [19]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12913709\n  [20]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18082223\n  [21]: https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Trieb%20und%20Kultur&author=H.%20Christoffel&publication_year=1944\n  [22]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913-h/3913-h.htm\n  [23]: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/456165-overview\n  [24]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429513008546\n  [25]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26666410", "14602": "Stockholm Syndrome does exist. It has an exceptionally high face validity. It does have this attribute due to many case reports available in the non-medical newspapers. You see a pattern, you have a desire to name it.\n\nThe trick of taxonomy is trying to explain this behaviour pattern, many psychological theories stand at the ready: \n\n[Traumatic Entrapment, Appeasement and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Evolutionary Perspectives of Hostage Reactions, Domestic Abuse and the Stockholm Syndrome:][1]\n> Evolutionary theory and cross-species comparisons are explored to shed new insights into behavioural responses to traumatic entrapment, examining their relationships to the Stockholm syndrome (a specific response to traumatic entrapment) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [\u2026]\n The neurobiological basis of defensive behaviours underlying PTSD is explored with reference to the triune brain model. Victims of protracted traumatic entrapment under certain circumstances may display the Stockholm syndrome, which involves paradoxically positive relationships with their oppressors that may persist beyond release. Similar responses are observed in many mammalian species, especially primates. Ethological concepts including dominance hierarchies, reverted escape, de-escalation and conditional reconciliation appear relevant and are illustrated. These phenomena are commonly encountered in victims of severe abuse and understanding these concepts may assist clinical management. Appeasement is the mammalian defence most relevant to the survival challenge presented by traumatic entrapment and appears to be the foundation of complex PTSD. Evolutionary perspectives have considerable potential to bridge and integrate neurobiology and the social sciences with respect to traumatic stress responses.\n\nTo properly diagnose a new \"syndrome\" you need to measure \"symptoms\", and [make comparisons][2] to enable a differential diagnosis. One such scale applying the concept of \"Stockholm Syndrome\" to dating complications is presented here:\n\n> [**A scale for identifying \"Stockholm syndrome\" reactions in young dating women: factor structure, reliability, and validity:**][3]\n> \n\n\nBut the whole process is hampered by the rarity in which subjects are scientifically examined compared to the media coverage if such a case is presumed to be present. That concept is now apparently highly attractive for lay persons to explain counter intuitive behaviour up to a point that Stockholm Syndrome now almost replaced the previously assumed intuitive behavioural response of intense hatred. That is the weakness expressed by different researchers in the question. Psychological and psychiatric symptoms, disorders and syndromes are highly influenced or even dependent on culture. (cf. DSM and homosexuality). At the moment the process of clearly defining Stockholm syndrome as a distinct category that is really sharply defined against alternatives and related concepts is not finished:\n\n> [**\u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019: psychiatric diagnosis or urban myth?**][4]\n> The existing literature on the subject of \u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019 is sparse; the majority of the literature is based on case reports with little reference to how \u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019 was diagnosed and what, if any, is its significance in terms of management of victims. \u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019 is rarely mentioned in peer-reviewed academic research.[\u2026]<br>\n> In summary, a systematic literature review has identified large gaps in research into \u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019. Existing literature does very little to support its existence yet case studies demonstrate a possible pattern in the behaviour and experiences of people labelled with it. We found similarities between widely reported cases studies into hostage \u2044 kidnap victims that could be used as the basis for diagnostic criteria. We also suggest that labelling the hostage victim with a psychiatric syndrome makes their story more readable and more likely to boost media circulation. The mystery of the origins of psychiatric illness holds society with fascination; psychiatry does not deal in absolute values and definitions, it is easy for the media to have free reign with medical terms, such as \u2018Stockholm syndrome\u2019 that have, as yet not received comprehensive assessment and validating criteria.\n\n\n  [1]: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048670701261178\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3415129\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8555117\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18028254", "14398": "[Fasting has some medical applications][1]. Among them is [*pre*-operative fasting][2] which involves wounds. \n\nBut wound healing is basically a status of greatly increased nutritional demands. So, yes, fasting while wounded tends to be a not so good idea:\n\n> [**Basics in nutrition and wound healing:**][3]\n> Therefore, local wound management and good documentation of the wound is essential for non-delayed wound healing and prevention of the development of chronic wounds. During the wound-healing process much energy is needed. The energy for the building of new cells is usually released from body energy stores and protein reserves. This can be very challenging for undernourished and malnourished patients.\n\nFrom that article:<br>\nInfluence of undernutrition on wound healing\nEven in uncomplicated starvation, as during a prolonged fasting, the body of an average adult subject loses 60 to 70 g of protein (240\u2013280 g of muscle tissue) per day. However, severe trauma or sepsis can increase the loss of body protein up to 150 to 250 g (600\u20131000 g of muscle tissue) per day. Wound healing is delayed in subjects who had periods of starvation (simple or stress starvation) before injury or a surgical procedure due to the lack of endogenous substrates. Further undernutrition impedes wound healing in addition to:\n\n- Delayed neovascularization and decreased collagen synthesis   \n- Prolonged phase of inflammation\n- Decreased phagocytosis by leukocytes\n- Dysfunction of B and T cells\n- Decreased mechanical strength of the skin\n\n\n> ## Proteins\n> Proteins play the most important role throughout the entire wound-healing process. Lymphocytes, leukocytes, phagocytes, monocytes, and macrophagesdimmune system cellsdare mainly comprised of proteins and are necessary to initiate a healthy inflammatory response in the healing process. An adequate supply with proteins is necessary for consistent wound healing. Because collagen is the protein that is produced mainly in the healing wound, a lack of protein decreases the synthesis of collagen and the production of fibroblasts.<br>\nOf course, all proteinogenic amino acids are important during wound healing. There is evidence that some amino acids are especially important for the process. Methionine and cysteine are involved in the synthesis of connective tissue and collagen. Arginine is thought to have a major influence on the proliferation of collagen accretion and on an improved immune reaction.\n\n\nAnd of course there is an increased need for fatty acids, vitamin C, iron, zinc etc. From a surgeon's perspective these points need to be considered:\n\n> [**The metabolic effects of fasting and surgery:**][4]\n> - fasting rapidly affects metabolism, although gradually adaptation occurs to minimize protein losses\n-  surgery increases metabolic rate and catabolism, of which insulin resistance is related to the magnitude of surgery\n-  insulin treatment in insulin-resistant patients after surgery or trauma markedly improves body metabolism and reduces morbidity and mortality\n-  avoiding preoperative fasting reduces postoperative insulin resistance by about 50% and attenuates postoperative impairment in nitrogen losses, lean body mass and muscle function\n-  fasting or deficient energy intake after surgery does not affect postoperative insulin resistance but does accelerate nitrogen losses\n-  perioperative parenteral nutrition has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with malnutrition, but has no beneficial effects in well fed patients\n-  oral supplements perioperatively may attenuate postoperative weight loss and reduce infectious complications\n-  patients undergoing surgery within a multimodal programme designed to reduce stress and to improve postoperative function display only minor insulin resistance, which allows feeding without hyperglycaemia\n\n[![Nutrition, Anabolism, and the Wound Healing Process, p2][5]][5]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive view of nutrition and wound healing, take a look at\n> [**Nutrition, Anabolism, and the Wound Healing Process: An Overview:**][6]\n> One is activation of the stress response to injury, and the second is the development of any protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Any significant wound leads to a hypermetabolic and catabolic state, and nutritional needs are significantly increased. The healing wound depends on adequate nutrient flow. Of particular concern is the presence of any PEM, PEM being defined as a deficiency of energy and protein intake to meet bodily demands. PEM in the presence of a wound leads to the loss of lean body mass (LBM) or protein stores, **which will in and of itself impede the healing process.** Early aggressive nutrient and micronutritional feeding is essential to control and prevent this process from developing. PEM is commonly seen in the chronic wound population, especially the elderly, disabled, or chronically ill populations where chronic wounds tend to develop.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting#Medical_application\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preoperative_fasting\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20692599\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17080694\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/juFZT.jpg\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19274069", "14321": "Hunger is far more complicated than \"my weight is below normal for my height, I should eat now.\" It's not some sort of correction mechanism that turns on and off to make your weight go up and down.\n\nOn a first approximation, you feel hungry because your stomach is empty and/or your blood sugar is low. People can drink water or eat lettuce to fill up their stomachs, and that works a little.

Because the genetic material is essentially the same, they resemble each other closely.\n\nTypically during ovulation only one ovum is released to be fertilized by one sperm. However, sometimes a woman's ovaries release two ova. Each must be fertilized by a separate sperm cell. If she has intercourse with two different men, the two ova can be fertilized by sperm from different sexual partners. The term for this event is [heteropaternal superfecundation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1488855) (HS): twins who have the same mother, but two different fathers.\n\nThis has been proven in *paternity suits* (in which there will be a bias selecting for possible infidelity) involving fraternal twins, where genetic testing must be done on each child. The frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation *in this group* was found (in one study) to be 2.4%.

(...)\n> The sound generated by joint manipulation has been classified\nvariously throughout osteopathic medical literature, being\nreferred to as an \u201carticular crack,\u201d \u201carticular pop,\u201d \u201cclunk,\u201d\n\u201ccrepitus,\u201d \u201cjoint click,\u201d \u201csnap,\u201d \u201csynovial grind,\u201d and \u201cthud,\u201d\nand it has been described as a \u201cgrating\u201d sound in the general\nmedical literature (Figure 3). The articular release may be accompanied\nby a loud audible release or a soft joint sound\u2014but it can\nalso be inaudible. (...) **The articular crack occurs for patients in both healthy and diseased states. It can be heard during normal functioning.**\n\nAbout long-term, habitual cracking:\n\n> Is articular release necessary to maintain joint health? (...) A person who\nundergoes habitual cracking does so for the feeling of relief and\ngreater motion in the involved joint. If one were to consider the\nanatomic and physiologic models solely, one could assume\nthat maintaining motion throughout the joint could lower the\nlikelihood of developing osteoarthritis. On the other hand, the\nexcessive use of a joint could lead to laxity of the ligaments supporting\nthe joint, causing hypermobility or introducing an\nunnecessary stress that could eventually cause dysfunction. \n\nThere is nothing about the neck, but there is about knuckles, as researchers are generally more interested in investigating knuckle and hand cracking:\n\n> Swezey and Swezey studied the prevalence of knuckle\ncracking in geriatric men in comparison to 11-year-old children\nand found that their data failed to show that cracking leads to\ndegenerative joint disease in the MCP joint in old age. **The\nchief morbid consequence of habitual joint cracking appeared\nto be the annoyance inflicted on the casual observer.**\n\nIf you're more interested in what exactly causes this strange sounds, I recommend reading [\"Real-Time Visualization of Joint Cavitation][2]\" (2015). There is a very interesting history section. But the final conclusion is:\n> Our data support the view that tribonucleation is the process which governs joint cracking. This process is characterized by rapid separation of surfaces with subsequent cavity formation, not bubble collapse as has been the prevailing viewpoint for more than a half century. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12033758\n  [2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398549/", "9429": "This is a health site, so I'm only answering the part about **health dangers of binge eating:**\n\n**1.

Patients in the intervention group were administered fresh juice from 50 g of C. papaya leaves once a day 15 min after breakfast for 3 consecutive days. In addition, they received the standard treatment for dengue. The controls only received the standard treatment. The final analysis was conducted on 111 patients from the intervention group and 117 controls. The study found that there was a significant increase in the platelet counts in the intervention group at the end of 40 h when compared to the counts 8 h after the intervention began. This significant increase was not observed in the control group. An increase in arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase and the platelet-activating factor receptor gene expression was also observed in the intervention group.

However, there are groups of females that do find tampon use uncomfortable, chief among them adolescents. For this reason, physicians often speak with adolescents at menarche about tampon use.\n\n>With regard to comfort, girls often choose tampons of too high absorbency. Highly absorbent tampons may cause discomfort in young girls because of their larger size or because of a drying effect during wear and upon withdrawal. Advise your patient to choose the lowest tampon absorbency for her needs by experimenting with a pad or pantiliner for backup protection. Less absorbent products can be used on lighter days. This guidance is also consistent with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s current recommendations for reducing the risk of menstrual toxic shock syndrome.\n\nIn other words, young girls should use smaller tampons.

The LES is located where the esophagus meets the stomach -- below the rib cage and slightly left of center. Normally it opens to allow food into the stomach or to permit belching, then closes again. But if the LES opens too often or does not close tight enough, stomach acid can reflux, or seep, into the esophagus and cause the burning sensation.\n\nThis would seem to be something of a union of both theories of heartburn. I was slightly doubtful - the article doesn't cite a particular source - but I was able to do a bit of digging on my own and found a few papers and other reliable sources that support this.\n\n - [Boeckxstaens (2005)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15836451) states (abstract only)\n > The two typical examples of dysfunction of the LOS are achalasia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). . . . GORD results from failure of the antireflux barrier, with increased exposure of the oesophagus to gastric acid. This leads to symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, and in more severe cases to oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and even carcinoma.\n\n - [The Keck School of Medicine](http://www.surgery.usc.edu/thoracic/esophagealmotilitydisorders.html) states\n > The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx in the throat to the stomach. There are two sphincters at each end, an upper esophageal sphincter and a lower esophageal sphincter. With normal swallowing there is an incredible coordination of neurologic and muscular events for the food or liquid to efficiently pass from the mouth and into the stomach. Any dysfunction in this process can manifest as difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, and even heartburn.\n - [Spechler et a.

This isn't always the case, but it generally is the case for instances of persistent heartburn.\n\n---\n\n<sup>1</sup> The Mayo Clinic also has [a rather accessible article](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/basics/causes/con-20019545) for anyone who doesn't want to trudge through scientific papers.", "4284": "The exact value depends on a lot of things - skin tone, the time of day, latitude,  how deep the shade is,... \n\nThe study [Vitamin D effective ultraviolet wavelengths due to scattering in shade][1] found that the UVB radiation at 280\u2013320 nanometers that is needed for vitamin D production dropped to levels at around 50% in a tree shade and under an umbrella.

In any case, as long as the exercise is age appropriate (Such as don't have your 10 year old squatting 250) and supervised, there shouldn't be an impact.\n\nFrom there, you have kids who are:\n\n  - Athletic.\n  - Used to spending focused time on physical training.\n  - Used to moving their bodies.\n  - Used to drills/skills: activities that are not sports themselves, but necessary for helping sports.\n\nAlso consider the following two study excerpts:\n\n>Experimental training protocols with weights and resistance machines and with supervision and low instructor/participant ratios are relatively safe and do not negatively impact growth and maturation of pre- and early pubertal youth.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17119361\n\n>Numerous studies have demonstrated that with appropriate supervision and precautions, resistance training can be safe and effective for children and adolescents. \n\nand \n\n>[Resistance training had] no detrimental effect on linear growth.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16437017\n\nWith all of that, there is the possibility that pushing children in exercise programs without paying attention to rest and nutrition needs could possibly result in growth impairment due to overly high stress levels or malnutrition.

[The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/) (part of the NIH), for example, says that\n> Polycarbonate plastics have many applications including use in some food and drink packaging, e.g., water and infant bottles, compact discs, impact-resistant safety equipment, and medical devices. Epoxy resins are used as lacquers to coat metal products such as food cans, bottle tops, and water supply pipes.\n\nThese epoxies are what is used in the cans for canned foods, and they contain BPA. It subsequently leaks out in minute quantities, although this is thought to be related to the temperature of the can, not aging.\n\n**Is BPA a hazard to human health?**\n\nThis is not quite as clear. The FDA has changed [its stance](http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm064437.htm#current) over time as new research showed different conclusions. [Its most recent memo](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/UCM424266.pdf) reviewed previous studies. One recent one found that adults are exposed to about 0.2 micrograms of BPA per day, while young children and infants are exposed to about 0.5 micrograms per day.<sup>1</sup> However, other research had shown that hazardous levels were in general orders of magnitude higher than these doses. Thus, in the FDA's most recent findings, BPA in food cans is not a problem. However, the agency has made it clear that it continues to revise its recommendations as new information is available.<sup>2</sup>\n\nNone of this should be taken to mean that BPA is not hazardous to humans. Higher amounts can prove toxic, as the chemical is thought to disrupt the endocrine system (see [Rochester (2013)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994667) and [Ihde et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680775)). This can, in some cases, lead to severe effects, possibly including cancer, and especially when applied to children. It may also cause neurological harm (see [Negri-Cesi (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26672480) and [Inadera (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26664253)).\n\nIn short, while BPA may pose a threat to humans in high enough quantities, its presence in canned food linings does not appear to be dangerous.\n\n---\n<sup>1 This drastic difference is due to the previous use of BPA in some drinking containers used by infants.

For women it increased from 36.7 to 47.5%. Results are robust to different models for projections of cancer rates.\n\n[Trends in the lifetime risk of developing cancer in Great Britain: comparison of risk for those born from 1930 to 1960][1]\n\n(This is for Great Britain, but at least for the US and similar countries, I don't expect too much deviation) \n\nCancer Research UK has done a bit of legwork as it relates to your question. Their rough estimate is that 4 out of 10 cancers are preventable through a healthy lifestyle. From their section on [preventable cancers][2]:\n\n> - Smoking is the largest single cause of cancer in the UK, linked to an estimated 19% of cancer cases in the UK each year. Lung cancer has the highest proportion of smoking-linked cases.\n> - Diet (too little fruit, vegetables and fibre; too much red and processed meat and salt) is linked to an estimated 9% of cancer cases in the UK each year. Upper aero-digestive tract cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophageal, and larynx) have the highest proportion of diet-linked cases.\n> - Overweight and obesity is linked to an estimated 5% of cancer cases in the UK each year. Uterine, kidney and oesophageal cancers have the highest proportions of bodyweight-linked cases.\n> - Alcohol is linked to an estimated 4% of cancer cases in the UK each year. Upper aero-digestive tract cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, and oesophageal) have the highest proportion of alcohol-linked cases.\n\nThat's about 37 percent, all added up. They have more information on all these on the website I linked. \n\nI did a bit of looking around myself, just to see. \n\n**Male**\n\n[The main cancer risks for males are:][3]\n\n - Prostate, at about 15 percent \n - Lung, at about 7.5 percent \n - Colon, at about 5 percent \n - Bladder, at about 4 percent \n - Skin, at about 2.5 percent \n - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, at about 2 percent \n - Kidney, at about 2 percent \n\nThat adds up to about 38 percent. \n\nLet's see how lifestyle factors impact them. \n\nFor [*prostate cancer*][4], the four factors you link possibly don't have an impact. Diet might be involved, but we don't really know how:\n\n> Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products appear to have a slightly higher chance of getting prostate cancer. These men also tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Doctors aren\u2019t sure which of these factors is responsible for raising the risk.\n\nFor *lung cancer*, smoking is of course the major risk factor. For non-smokers, risk of lung cancer is reduced by about [85 to 90 percent][5]\n\nFor *colon cancer*, about half of the cases [are linked to lifestyle][6]. \n\nFor *bladder cancer*, about half of the cases are [linked to smoking alone][7]. \n\n*Skin cancer* is caused by sun exposure, but also genetic disposition.\n\nThe risk factors for *non-hodgkins-lymphoma* [are unknown][8]. \n\nFor *kidney cancer*, risk factors include obesity and smoking, with an estimated [40 percent of the risk][9] coming from lifestyle factors. \n\nSo, as a back of the envelope calculation, if the risks for prostate and non-hodgkins-lymphoma don't decrease, the lung cancer risk decreases by about 90 percent, and the other listed cancer have a risk decrease of about half, we end up with about 25 percent of the original 38 percent for these 7 cancer types. A reduction of 35 percent. \n\n**Female**\n\nThe main cancers differ for females:\n\n - Breast, at about 12 percent \n - Lung, at about 7 percent \n - Colon, at about 4.5 percent \n - Uterine, at about 3 percent \n\nAll others are below 2 percent. These four add up to 26.5 of the lifetime risk. \n\nThe relationship between *breast cancer* and lifestyle factors seems to be complicated, with it [maybe being linked to obesity and also linked to number of children][10]. \n\nAbout 40 percent of *Uterine cances* [are linked to obesity][11]. \n\nLung and colon cancer were also on the list for males. Another back of the envelope calculation reduces the risk of these four cancers from 26.5 to 16.5 percent. A reduction of 38 percent. \n\n**Disclaimers**\n\n - These are very rough calculations \n - These are based only on lifetime risk of developing cancers, not lifetime risks of dying from cancers \n - We really don't understand cancer all that well for many of them\n - the cancers I didn't list here, like bladder/cervix/pancreatic cancer also make up quite a few percent of the lifetime cancer risk, combined \n\n  [1]: http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v112/n5/full/bjc2014606a.html\n  [2]: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk#heading-One\n  [3]: http://m.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer\n  [4]: http://m.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-risk-factors\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170525/\n  [6]: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer/risk-factors\n  [7]: http://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/bladder-cancer-men-at-risk\n  [8]: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/basics/causes/con-20027792\n  [9]: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/kidney-cancer/risk-factors#heading-Zero\n  [10]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204500002540\n  [11]: http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/uterine-cancer/risk-factors-and-prevention", "3941": "\"Normal\" eyelid twitching can possibly be caused or be made worse by lack of sleep, or too much caffeine or stress.

Also, addiction has been studied in relation of people's habit of eating food that is prepared with a combination of ingredients, as donuts or french fries, not separated ingredients. There are many studies that **address the issue of excessive consumption of food as a real addiction**, similar to that caused by drugs such as cocaine, heroin, alcohol and tobacco (Blumenthal & Gold, 2010; Moreno & Tandon, 2011).\n\nDr. Ifland identifies the **refined products (sweeteners, carbohydrates, fat, salt and caffeine) as the substances that have the greatest potential to cause addiction**. Our body is programmed to recognize sugars and fatty substances as fundamental for life and health: they're energy reserves and address us toward the consumption of fruit, rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. With the refining of foods we have an exaggerated concentration of sugars and fats, and this disrupts our evolutionary adaptation (Ifland et al., 2009).\n\nIn the **explanation of the mechanisms** of addiction, there are at least three factors that contribute to the excessive consumption of foods. In the case of sugar and refined flour, part of the explanation goes through the concept of glycemic index: foods with **high glycemic index** - and load - cause a rise in blood sugar, which leads to an increase of insulinemia and subsequent hypoglycemia that is felt as hunger (Lennerz et al., 2013; Ludwig, 2002). Other explanations rely on the production of **endogenous opioids** caused by sugars that then would act as stimulants (Drewnowski, Krahn, Demitrack, Nairn, & Gosnell, 1992, 1995), and the lower efficiency of **dopamine receptors**, which would lead to increased consumption of food to achieve the same satisfaction (Wang et al., 2001; Wang, Volkow, Thanos, & Fowler, 2004). Lastly, a final interpretation refers to the fact that a high consumption of carbohydrates leads to increased levels of **serotonin**, which is perceived as a pleasant sensation (Wurtman, 1988).\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBlumenthal, D.

However, in practicality there are [decent][oo] observational [data][aa] available.\n\nBecause hiccups stem from a reflex arc involving the vagal nerve, physical maneuvers that stimulate the vagus often abort hiccups.\n\nThese may include:   \n   \n- Breath holding\n- [Valsalva maneuver][vm] (exhaling against a closed glottis)\n- Stimulating the nasopharynx or glottis (e.g. gargling cold water; upside down is often (reasonably) recommended to route water up into the nasopharynx where is is more likely to cause vagal stimulation)\n\nIf none of these is successful, medications are occasionally used. The oldest and most well-established treatment is [chlorpromazine][cp] (a.k.a. Thorazine), a first-generation antipsychotic.

However, particularly intractable hiccups have been associated with serious conditions including intracranial problems such as stroke or encephalitis as well as many different kinds of cancer.

Some researchers hypothesis that it is the resveratrol that leads to reduce atherosclerosis. This thought comes from the French paradox or the resveratrol paradox [[1]]. The paradox is why do the French live so long with a diet high in saturated fats while they also consume a lot of red wine (since alcohol is a poison).\n\nHowever, correlation doesn't equal causation, i.e, there can be third a factor. Researchers from Harvard found that being stressed and unhappy can have lasting negative effects on the body [[2]]:\n\n>A vast scientific literature has detailed how negative emotions harm the body. Serious, sustained stress or fear can alter biological systems in a way that, over time, adds up to \u201cwear and tear\u201d and, eventually, illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Chronic anger and anxiety can disrupt cardiac function by changing the heart\u2019s electrical stability, hastening atherosclerosis, and increasing systemic inflammation.\n\nHow does this relate to moderating drinking? It relates to moderate drinking through research on social circles and prolonged life spans. A team of Australian researchers found that individuals with stronger and bigger social circles have a longer life span [[3]].\n\n>Survival time may be enhanced by strong social networks. Among older Australians, these may be important in lengthening survival.\n\nHow do we parse this information? Many who drink moderately tend to go out for that glass of wine and when they go out there is a social aspect to the setting. Husband/wife, children, dinner with other couples, etc. That is, there is a continual social bound occurring. So is it alcohol that is benefit or social circle? Does a positive social circle have an effect on stress and longevity? Luckily [Dr. Martin Seligman](http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/bio.htm) from the University of Pennsylvania has already done the research. His work as well as many other researchers on the subject are cited, quoted, and expanding on in *Perceptions of Longevity and Successful Aging in Very Old Adults* by Katie E. Cherry, Loren D. Marks, Tim Benedetto, Marisa C. Sullivan, and Alyse Barker:\n\n>Ample experimental evidence documents the association between religious participation and mortality, where religious individuals live longer than do their non-religious counterparts (e.g., McCullough, Friedman, Enders, & Martin, 2009). For example, Hummer, Rogers, Nam, and Ellison (1999) have shown that Americans who attend worship services twice a week live an average of 7.6 years longer than their non-attending counterparts (a figure that nearly doubles to 13.7 years among African Americans; see Marks et al., 2005). Hummer et al.\u2019s study was based on a national sample of 20,000+ that included a variety of faiths (Christian and non-Christian) and received the highest possible rating (\u201810\u2019) for methodological rigor (Koenig et. al., 2001, p. 562). The \u201ckey\u201d to this longevity difference in Hummer et al. appeared to be frequency of worship service attendance, not world faith or denomination (see also Gillum, King, Obisesan, & Koenig, 2008; Hill, Angel, Ellison, & Angel, 2005; Musick, House, & Williams, 2004) [[4]].\n\nHummer et al. noted that the key to longevity was the frequency of attending a social event in this case church, but if you read the entire pub med paper in [[4]], you will see this extends to non-church social event frequency as well.\n\nSo researchers have shown that social circles lower stress, keep people happy, and promote longevity. Many of the researchers who look at moderator drinkers don't look at the social aspect of the group just the fact that they (A) consume moderate amount of alcohol and (B) haven't died of a heart attack. Therefore, they conclude A causes B but A could be causing more social get togethers where the moderate consumption of alcohol occurs and these social settings will help reduce stress, promote community, and belonging which promotes longevity which leads to lower rates of atherosclerosis.\n\nFrom the American Red Cross circulation *Red Wine and your Heart* [[5]]:\n\n>Despite considerable data from epidemiological studies and strong suggestions from experimental research, the evidence is still insufficient to encourage patients who do not drink to start consuming red wine as part of a strategy to protect against atherosclerosis. Too much alcohol consumption has been shown repeatedly to contribute to cardiovascular disorders such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy (which develops when the heart muscle becomes too weak to pump blood effectively), high blood pressure, and certain electrical disturbances of the heartbeat. Excessive alcohol use can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancers, pancreatitis, neurological disorders, motor vehicle accidents, and addiction. Individuals with a personal or family history of alcohol abuse or liver disease should avoid drinking alcohol. Nevertheless, many medical societies view light use of ethanol as potentially beneficial to the cardiovascular system, although no formal recommendations for light alcohol consumption have been made.\n\nThat is, alcohol has no formal recommendation and light consumption may be *beneficial*, but again there is no mention of environment. Moreover, the Mayo Clinic makes the same statement but never analyzed the persons environment as well [[6]]. \n\nUntil more studies start to look at social environmental factors and not just the consumption point of view, I don't think ingesting a poison to maximize life expectancy is the way to go since there is no medical recommendation on doing so; hence, it is still called the Resveratrol paradox and not a theory or fact.\n\n[1]:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398412/\n[2]:http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/happiness-stress-heart-disease/\n[3]:http://jech.bmj.com/content/59/7/574.abstract\n[4]:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3864892/\n[5]:http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/111/2/e10.full\n[6]:http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281?pg=2", "505": "Yes, SpO2 levels can be depressed in smokers, but the body will compensate for some of the effects which can explain why you may have had normal saturation levels. There are also age considerations, as well as how much a person smokes.\n\nOne of the culprits in cigarette smoke is CO, or Carbon Monoxide. CO shares the same binding sites as O2 in blood hemoglobin (Hg), and actually has 200 times greater affinity than O2. So when you smoke, the CO travels across and prevents some Hg from picking up oxygen. The net result is that your heart starts working harder to get more blood around, which can keep up your sat levels. There is a decent [plain English explanation here][1].\n\nIn addition to this, there are other changes that can occur in longtime smokers. [This study][2] from 1983 found that in females and smokers over 50 have associated increases in red cell volume and reduced plasma volume. This suggests that the body adapts to the decreased O2 count by producing more RBC's. While this sounds like a great adaptation, it also means that with the reduced plasma volume, the blood is \"thicker\", which means that the heart has to work harder to push it around.\n\n[This article][3] also notes decreased plasma volume and greater RBC counts in long time CO exposure subjects as well as other significant blood composition changes.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, O2 saturation is impaired by continued exposure to CO as a long term effect.

Truth be told, though, if there is a single class of drugs that has added more [quality-adjusted life-years][qaly] to human history than any other, steroids must be competing with just a few antibiotic classes for that title.\n\nTo make clear what we\u2019re talking about, the term \u201csteroid\u201d as a label for drugs generally refers to [glucocorticoids][gluco] (GCs) - drugs that act like cortisol, an endogenous steroid hormone. Commonly used GCs include:\n\n- **Short acting**: hydrocortisone, cortisone\n- **Intermediate-acting**: prednisone, prednisolone, mehthylprednisolone, triamcinolone\n- **Long-acting**: betamethasone, dexamethasone, paramethasone\n\nYour question poses a specific example of one indication for steroids but seems to be asking about the use of these drugs more generally. As others have brought up, any decision about drug treatment involves weighing the [**risk-benefit ratio**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93benefit_ratio).\n\nBenefits\n--------\nAlthough going through the efficacy data for various conditions is beyond the scope of this answer, I list a sampling of the common indications for GC treatment, and in the concluding paragraph I will provide specific efficacy data for arthritis.   \n\n- **Replacement therapy**: due to either primary adrenal insufficiency ([Addison\u2019s disease][ad]) or secondary/tertiary insufficiency (at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary.   \n\n- **Inflammatory conditions** (deep breath in): asthma, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, eosinophilic anything, inflammatory arthritis, anaphylaxis, septic shock (in very specific circumstances), polymyalgia rheumatica, polyarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis, minimal change glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, urticaria, autoimmune hepatitis\n\n- **Other things that aren\u2019t (necessarily) obviously inflammatory**: increased intracranial pressure, intractable nausea, acute leukemia, sarcoidosis, cluster headaches, dermatomyositis\n\nRisks\n-------\nFirst, please note that a few of the indications for GC require only a very brief burst of high-dose GC. In this time course, these drugs actually very few serious side effects (psychiatric effects and hyperglycemia are exceptions, but rarely outweigh the benefit). Over the longer term, however, supra-physiologic doses of GC have an array of adverse effects that fall into a few categories:\n  \n- **Suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis**: Exogenous GCs suppress the hypothalamic pathway that stimulates the adrenal gland, resulting in adrenal atrophy. This means that if the exogenous GC is abruptly discontinued, [adrenal crisis][ac] can ensue. The rule of thumb I learned was that >3 weeks treatment with  >10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) can cause HPA suppression. As a result, GC treatment that meets these criteria is generally ended with a taper, allowing the adrenal to regenerate, whereupon it can resume normal function.<br><br>\nThis side effect is usually a non-issue if the medication is tapered correctly. Therefore, the benefits of treatment will generally outweigh the risks.\n\n- **Cushing\u2019s syndrome**: This term is generally applied to the  constellation of symptoms occuring with chronic administration of supra-physiologic doses of GC. <br> \n - Hyperglycemia   \n - Hypertension  \n - Psychiatric effects: insomnia, precipitation of mania or psychosis in susceptible individuals\n - Salt retention<sup>1</sup>\n  - Decreased bone mineral density\n  - Weight gain: generally in a pattern characterized by central adiposity and peripheral muscle atrophy\n - Increased intra-ocular pressure\n\nSo, after all that:\n> Why do doctors prescribe steroid tablets though they knew the side effect?\n\nBecause the benefit outweighs the risk.<sup>2</sup> For the example you gave &mdash; arthritis<sup>3</sup> &mdash; the best paper I found was a [meta-analysis][vr] that used a statistical method that compares the [number needed to treat][nnt] (NNT) with the [number needed to harm][nnh] (NNH) for long-term (>1 year) treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The ratio there NNH/NNT was 0.25, which is considered \u201cgood.\u201d I\u2019ll let you read their methods if you\u2019d like the details.

Other papers refer to these genotypes as I (A), Ia (B), and II (C).  There were 4 cases in Guangdong on the other side of China nearer Yunnan who had the ancestral type A.\n\nThe fact that the majority of patients in Wuhan were infected with genotype B suggests that the disease did not develop there and was brought in from elsewhere, mutated possibly to B in Wuhan thereby becoming more lethal and infectious.  The Huanan Seafood Market was likely a super-spreader event since it was linked to 50% of the first 41 known cases though not all of the pandemic.

Using their published results, we showed that all virus contigs assembled from two lung samples (lung07 and lung08) exhibited low identities, ranging from 80.24% to 88.93%, with known SARSr-CoVs.

A person with a rather low setpoint may well have symptoms of thyrotoxicosis like irregular heart rhythm, increased heart rate etc. if the FT4 concentration is higher than her or his personal set point.\n\nThe potentially harmful consequences of this association were dramatically demonstrated by the Rotterdam study, which showed a fourfold-increased risk of sudden cardiac death in persons with FT4 concentration being in the highest tertile of the normal reference range [5].

Water will stimulate gastric emptying thus reducing the contact time of aspirin with gastric mucosa. *Note, that milk or fruit juice will slow down gastric emptying.* You can still take aspirin with food or with food and water.

Taken from \"[A Clinician's Guide to Oral Extended-Release Drug Delivery Systems in Epilepsy][1]\" (*italics* are mine):\n\n> **Delayed-Release (DR) Formulations**. The US Pharmacopeia (USP) defines DR as a dosage form that *does not release the medication promptly after administration. In other words, once a certain amount of time has lapsed, the drug is immediately and completely released*. The delayed release may be time sensitive or dependent on the environment (e.g., gastrointestinal pH). For example, an enteric coating can be used to intentionally delay drug release until after the tablet has passed through the stomach. This may reduce drug irritation of the gastric mucosa or prevent gastric juices from inactivating an acid-labile drug. \n>\n> **Extended-Release (ER) Formulations**. The USP defines ER as a dosage form *designed to release the medication in a controlled manner during an extended period of time, at a predetermined rate, duration, and location following administration*. At steady state, the rate of absorption is approximately equivalent to the rate of elimination due to metabolism and excretion.\n\nIt is evident that these are essentially two different profiles of a drug, as each type of formulation gives the drug a distinct behavior, which gives the drug better chances for efficacy:\n\n 1. The advantage in delayed-release formulations is not exactly an advantage **for the patient**. Rather, it's an advantage for the treatment, because using such formulations enables the doctor to treat the patient with drugs that could not be taken orally otherwise, such as acid-labile drugs (e.g. omeprazole for heartburn).\n 2. The advantage in extended-release formulations is more direct for the patient, because it allows the patient to take the drug less frequently, which is always preferable, as it increases the chances of adherence to the treatment (compare taking a tablet 6 times a day to once a day. It is obviously a lot easier to take a tablet once a day and be done with it, than having to stop what you are  doing every few hours and take a tablet).\n\nThis figure from the above-cited paper demonstrates this discussion very clearly:\n[![IR vs. DR and ER drug formulations][2]][2]\n\nIn the top figure, you can see that the pharmacokinetic profile for IR (immediate release) and DR are identical, only the DR profile occurs later, since it is only \"postponed\" as discussed above. ER, however, demonstrates a profile of a different shape, since the peak is lower, but higher concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time compared to the IR and DR formulations, which give only a short strong peak. \n\nThe advantage of ER formulations is even better elucidated in the bottom figure, where it is seen that taking an ER formulation **once a day** (compared to taking an IR formulations three times a day) provides desired serum concentrations throughout the day and with lower chances for side effects (the peak does not cross the top of the therapeutic range, as opposed to the sharp peaks of IR formulations), and lower chances for dropping to subtherapeutic concentrations (the peak does not cross the bottom of the therapeutic range, as opposed to the sharp peaks of IR formulations).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117810/\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPDk3.jpg", "20102": "Screening tests are done across the population of asymptomatic people at risk of a disease (e.g. mammogram to look for breast cancer in all women with breasts) to try to catch disease early in its course.  \n\nDiagnostic tests are done when a patient presents with symptoms.\n\nThe [ROMA test][1] is a diagnostic test done when a woman presents with an adnexal mass, and uses serum markers (CA125, HE4) to stratify the risk of the mass being cervical cancer in that individual.  It is generally done after a pelvic ultrasound, and helps guide decisions regarding biopsy etc. \n\nCurrently, most professional organizations including [the USPSTF do NOT recommend screening for ovarian cancer][2]:\n\n> **Rationale** \n>\n> **Importance** - The age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer from\n> 2010 to 2014 was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year.1 Ovarian\n> cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women\n> and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer, despite its\n> low incidence.1 Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer each\n> year in the United States. More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths\n> occur among women 45 years and older.2\n> \n> **Detection** - The positive predictive value of screening tests for ovarian\n> cancer is low, and most women with a positive screening test result do\n> not have ovarian cancer (ie, many women without ovarian cancer will\n> have a false-positive result on screening tests).\n> \n> **Benefits of Screening** - The USPSTF found adequate evidence that\n> screening with transvaginal ultrasound, testing for the serum tumor\n> marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), or a combination of both does not\n> reduce ovarian cancer mortality.\n> \n> **Harms of Screening** - The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening\n> for ovarian cancer can result in important harms, including many\n> false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary surgical\n> interventions in women who do not have cancer. Depending on the type\n> of screening test used, the magnitude of harm ranges from moderate to\n> substantial and reflects the risk for unnecessary diagnostic surgery.\n> The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the psychological harms of\n> screening for ovarian cancer.\n> \n> **USPSTF Assessment** - The USPSTF concludes that there is at least moderate\n> certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the\n> benefits.\n\nTo summarize, screening tests are generally done population-wide when the population-wide benefits of catching early disease ***outweighs the harms*** of the testing/treatment done on the ***false positive cases*** of those screening tests.  Testing and treating a false-positive can have serious or even fatal consequences.  The benefits and risks are weighed carefully when deciding whether to screen population-wide.\n\nScreening for an individual based on their risks (e.g. first degree family members with ovarian cancer, environmental exposures or genetic mutations known to increase risk, etc) is NOT considered population-wide screening, it is something discussed with an individual's physician in their wellness visit, and is based on individual factors.\n\n**Once *any* test (whether screening or diagnostic) is performed, *any positive results ABSOLUTELY MUST be followed up by the physician* to discuss risks and benefits of the next steps in diagnosis and/or treatment.**  That is why the risks of diagnostics/treatments of false positive results (which occur at least a small % of the time in *any* test) have to be considered when deciding whether there is more harm or benefit to screening at a population level.  \n\nWithout giving an entire lecture on biostatistics... for example, if a screening test were to have a 5% false positive rate, and we screened a population of 1 million women, about 50,000 of those women screened would have a falsely positive result that would result in unnecessary additional tests/treatment.  But when considering an individual, many other factors may change the balance of risks/benefits to favor doing testing, so that is why primary care providers are (usually) well trained in both doing and *discussing* screening tests with patients, to guide each individual in what is best for them.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009898114005208\n  [2]: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2672638", "19950": "Are PPIs effective in prevention of esophageal carcinoma in individuals with Barrett's esophagus? **The evidence is conflicting**; I listed it from yes to no.\n\n[Acid-suppressive medications and risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's oesophagus: a systematic review and meta-analysis (Gut, 2014)][2]:\n\n> Based on meta-analysis of observational studies, the use of PPIs is\n> associated with a decreased risk of OAC and/or BO-HGD in patients with\n> BO.

When it comes to that final phase of translating stem cell discoveries into clinical therapies for patients, it won\u2019t be individual universities working in isolation. It will be multi-institutional collaborations with our neighbors that will transform medicine over the course of the 21st century.\n\nLytal also points out that while organ (re)generation research is underway, researchers in\u00a0[Megan McCain\u2019s lab][5] at the [USC Viterbi School of Engineering][6] are building human heart tissue and researchers in [Henry Sucov's Lab][7], at USC Stem Cell, are trying to harness the heart\u2019s innate ability to heal. They\u2019re studying a regenerative type of heart muscle cell called a mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte (MNDCM) &mdash; see [Patterson et al. (2018)][8].\n\nNewborns have large numbers of these cells, but adults have relatively few, so the adult body has trouble regenerating heart tissue after injury.\n\nWhen they looked for these cells in mice, they found that some mice had more of these cells than other mice did. They traced that variation to a gene called *Tnni3k*. Their research suggests that blocking the gene might boost numbers of regenerative cells.\n\nThe work in Megan McCain's lab...\n>poses problems that call for the mindset of an engineer. It turns out that heart muscle cells don\u2019t fully mature in the typical laboratory environment for growing cells\u2014a petri dish filled with warm, nutritious liquid. To develop properly, heart muscle cells need to get some exercise by contracting in the rhythm of a beating heart. To do this, they need structure and resistance, which the lab\u2019s researchers provide in the form of a tiny scaffold called a chip. ([Lytal, 2018][2])\n\nSo while we have been able to create certain tissues using stem cells, creating a complete and transplantable human organ is a lot more complex and requires further research, which is well underway with the work in labs of the University of Southern California.\n\n## References\n\nLytal, C.

Tyramine has a strange history with headaches, because originally, as [Martin and Vij (2016)][1] point out, people noticed that individuals on MAOI drugs who ate tyramine rich foods developed hypertensive headaches.  When thinking about migraines, it's strange to think that a vasoconstrictor would induce a migraine, since triptans and caffeine are used to *treat* migraines.  \n\nHowever, this paradox leads to the thought that while the treatment of migraines may be vascular, the disease itself may be one of metabolism, as I mentioned in another migraine post and referenced [Kokavec, A.

One such pathway is mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD(+) biosynthesis, and the NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1. Here, we show that NAMPT-mediated NAD(+) biosynthesis is severely compromised in metabolic organs by high-fat diet (HFD). Strikingly, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a product of the NAMPT reaction and a key NAD(+) intermediate, ameliorates glucose intolerance by restoring NAD(+) levels in HFD-induced T2D mice. NMN also enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity and restores gene expression related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm, partly through SIRT1 activation. Furthermore, NAD(+) and NAMPT levels show significant decreases in multiple organs during aging, and NMN improves glucose intolerance and lipid profiles in age-induced T2D mice. These findings provide critical insights into a potential nutriceutical intervention against diet- and age-induced T2D.\n\n- 2016: [Nicotinamide Riboside Opposes Type 2 Diabetes and Neuropathy in Mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep26933)\n\n  > Male C57BL/6J mice raised on high fat diet (HFD) become prediabetic and develop insulin resistance and sensory neuropathy. The same mice given low doses of streptozotocin are a model of type 2 diabetes (T2D), developing hyperglycemia, severe insulin resistance and diabetic peripheral neuropathy involving sensory and motor neurons. Because of suggestions that increased NAD+ metabolism might address glycemic control and be neuroprotective, we treated prediabetic and T2D mice with nicotinamide riboside (NR) added to HFD. NR improved glucose tolerance, reduced weight gain, liver damage and the development of hepatic steatosis in prediabetic mice while protecting against sensory neuropathy. In T2D mice, NR greatly reduced non-fasting and fasting blood glucose, weight gain and hepatic steatosis while protecting against diabetic neuropathy. The neuroprotective effect of NR could not be explained by glycemic control alone. Corneal confocal microscopy was the most sensitive measure of neurodegeneration. This assay allowed detection of the protective effect of NR on small nerve structures in living mice. Quantitative metabolomics established that hepatic NADP+ and NADPH levels were significantly degraded in prediabetes and T2D but were largely protected when mice were supplemented with NR.

The immune system is a complex thing and most will inhibit only one particular aspect of it.\n\n**Azathioprine**\n\nAzathioprine is an immunosuppressant drug. It has been around for a long time but is still widely used. Unlike certain modern drugs that inhibit various [inflammatory mediators][1] (like the [TNF inhibitors][2]), azathioprine works at the level of DNA to prevent DNA replication (by blocking the construction of DNA from purine building blocks and purine creation) and thus inhibit the proliferation and function of white blood cells (lymphocytes in particular).\n \nAdapted from [this paper][3]:\n\n> Azathioprine is among the oldest pharmacologic immunosuppressive\n> agents in use today. Over the past 50 years, azathioprine has been\n> used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, rheumatologic\n> diseases, solid organ transplantation, and inflammatory bowel disease.\n> \n> The drug is a purine analog, and the accepted mechanism of action is\n> at the level of DNA. Ultimately, azathioprine can then become\n> incorporated into replicating DNA and can also block the pathway of\n> purine synthesis. It is this action that is thought to contribute to\n> its relative specificity to lymphocytes due to their lack of a salvage\n> pathway. However, the effects on the blockade of DNA replication have\n> never fully explained all of the laboratory and clinical findings of\n> azathioprine-induced immunosuppression.\n\nThis effect on DNA replication also accounts for some of the potential side effects, such as increased risk of certain cancers, as well as the increased susceptibility to infection shared by all immunosuppressants. That is why infections must be identified and treated quickly in people on drugs like this. Vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcus are also recommended ([in the UK][4]).\n\n**Other sources**:\n\n - [Azathioprine in the British National Formulary][5]\n - [Azathioprine on Wikipedia][6]\n\n***\n\nFor anyone who is interested, here are two images showing the chemical structure of azathioprine on the left and purine (which it inhibits through [molecular mimicry][7]) on the right.

An alteration in [gonadotropin-releasing hormone][3] secretion results in increased luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This is what can affect the normal [menstrual cycle][4] and ovulation.\n 2.

Sunscreen makes a huge difference too.\n\nYou can get enough vitamin D from even a few minutes of sunlight, and also otherwise from cheap nutritional supplements.  Exposing your skin to solar UV is pretty much only a negative.\n\nWhether something is \"too paranoid\" is for each to judge for themselves, based on the facts.\n\n# The facts\n\nThe [WHO page *Are there beneficial effects of UV radiation?*](http://www.who.int/uv/faq/uvhealtfac/en/index1.html) advises this as to benefits of UV radiation:\n\n> There is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you! But **5 to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure of hands, face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin D levels high**. Closer to the equator, where UV levels are higher, even shorter periods of exposure suffice.\n>\n> Hence, for most people, vitamin D deficiency is unlikely. Possible exceptions are those who have very limited sun exposure such as the housebound elderly, or those with heavily pigmented skin who live in high-latitude countries where UV levels are relatively low.\n\nThey also advise on the negatives on the page [*What are the effects of UV on the skin?*](http://www.who.int/uv/faq/uvhealtfac/en/index2.html):\n\n> **There is no such thing as a healthy tan!** The skin produces a dark-coloured pigment, melanin, as a shield against further damage from UV radiation. The darkening provides some protection against sunburn: a dark tan on a white skin offers a sun protection factor of between 2 and 4. However, it is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer. A suntan may be cosmetically desirable, but in fact it is nothing but a sign that your skin has been damaged and has attempted to protect itself.\n\nAccording to [Cancer Research UK's facts page on skin cancer](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/skin-cancer#heading-Zero),\n\n> 1 in 54 people will be diagnosed with malignant melanoma during their lifetime.\n\nAccording to the same page, your chances of surviving after diagnosis for 1 year are 97%, for 5 years 90%, and for 10 years 90%.\n\nAccording to [Skin Cancer Foundation's facts page](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts#nonmelanoma), \n\n> **The vast majority of melanomas are caused by the sun.** In fact, one UK study found that about 86 percent of melanomas can be attributed to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.\n\n# In conclusion\n\nSwimwear is healthier the more it protects your skin from sunlight.\n\nThere are always some obstacles to always doing the healthiest thing though.  For instance\u2014\n\n - More clothing means more weight and heat, which may make going swimming less convenient for you, especially if you like to swim competitively and in warm water.  Since exercise is itself healthy, it would be unwise to discourage it by making it feel like a chore!\n - Cultural resistance: pool maintainers in some places ([e.g. France](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-swimming-pools-eg-in-France-insist-on-everyone-wearing-tight-Lycra-swimming-suits)) have been known to refuse guests with swimwear that doesn't look like swimwear, out of hygiene concerns.

Follow the advice given on the leaflet, by your pharmacist and doctor.\n\n\n\nTaking the example of cannabinoids, it is common knowledge that a full stomach will delay the effects of the active ingredients, but the simultaneous ingestion of a little bit of fat will increase the absorption of them. The more interesting molecules are all lipophilic and quite waste to digest in isolation.\n\nIt will be also a quite different story if we are talking about a one-time paracetamol administration or a long term course of aspirin, to name just one example pair.\n\nThe possible side-effects and interactions are different for each drug in question and each individual will fall on a different place of the scale of possible consequences. That does still not take into account the different foods that might interact with the drugs and the stomachs content.\n\nSome important problems to keep an eye on when reading the accompanying leaflet are for example time the drug is in the stomach (gastric emptying) or the pH with the drug and with or with food (buffering).\n\n\n[Prostaglandins, NSAIDs, and Gastric Mucosal Protection: Why Doesn\u2019t the Stomach Digest Itself?][8] (Physiol Rev 88: 1547\u20131565, 2008; doi:10.1152/physrev.00004.2008.)\n\nSince both other answers are basically correct on their own, I will only add some details that wouldn't fit into comments.\n\nConcernig absorption rates: \n[Absorption of acetylsalicylic acid from unbuffered and buffered gastric contents][9] and [Gastrointestinal Factors in Aspirin Absorption: A Quantitative Study][10] but that is in contrast to [Absorption of aspirin from the stomach in man][11], [Influence of food on aspirin absorption from tablets and buffered solutions][12], [Kinetics of aspirin absorption following oral administration of six aqueous solutions with different buffer capacities][13].\n\nThe most common side-effect of taking drugs orally is probably an upset stomach, but one of the more important effects might be actual bleeding, even with low dose aspirin: [Risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with use of low-dose aspirin][14]\n\nWhile the already mentioned COX inhibition is a problem in itself, many natural substances occurring naturally in food are also known to exhibit this action, very probably increasing the risk if even ever so slightly. Substances that might act in this way: \n> Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any \"natural\" supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, quercetin, resorcinol, and others.    \n> <sub>[Wikipedia: Aspirin][15]</sub>\n\nAs a personal anecdote I might also add saffron to the list of side-effects enhancers.\n\nBut look how aspirin and paracetamol differ in their pharmocokinetics.\n\n> These factors would modulate the kinetics in the inflammatory focus, thereby prolonging the therapeutic action of the drug beyond that expected based on analysis of plasma pharmacokinetics. However, ion trapping also results in acidic compounds achieving high concentrations in the stomach wall and kidney, in which blockade of prostanoid synthesis causes the typical organ toxicity elicited by these compounds. Due to their lack of acidic structure, other COX inhibitors, such as dipyrone and paracetamol, are distributed homogenously throughout the body at therapeutic doses and induce analgesia, but induce no or very slight anti-inflammatory effects. This is partly due to their low concentration in inflamed tissues.

But it can be bad for everything else. You sit, you concentrate, you stress your eyes.\n\nIt is such a common causal connection that the NHS simplifies the analysis of causes for myopia down to genes and:\n> Short-sightedness (myopia) usually occurs when the eyes grow slightly too long, which means they're unable to produce a clear image of objects in the distance.   \nIt's not clear exactly why this happens, but it's thought to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors that disrupt the normal development of the eye.      \n**Too little time outdoors**   \nResearch has found that spending time playing outside as a child may reduce your chances of becoming short-sighted, and existing short-sightedness may progress less quickly.   \nThis may be related to light levels outdoors being much brighter than indoors. Both sport and relaxation outdoors appear to be beneficial in reducing the risk of short-sightedness.   \n**Excessive close work**  \nSpending a lot of time focusing your eyes on nearby objects, such as reading, writing and possibly using hand-held devices (phones and tablets) and computers can also increase your risk of developing short-sightedness.    \nAn \"everything in moderation\" approach is therefore generally recommended. Although children should be encouraged to read, they should also spend some time away from reading and computer games each day doing outdoor activities.   \n><sub>[NHS: Short-sightedness (myopia), Causes][1] (2015)</sub>\n\n\"Too little time outdoors\" is a shortcut for expressing giving the muscles and lenses of your eyes a workout with natural variation. Outdoors you usually have to focus objects that vary quite a bit in terms of distance etc. The evidence is slowly coming in for interventions regarding these stresses to improve things:\n\n> A stronger effect was found at a school in southern Taiwan, where teachers were asked to send children outside for all 80 minutes of their daily break time instead of giving them the choice to stay inside. After one year, doctors had diagnosed myopia in 8% of the children, compared with 18% at a nearby school\n> <sub>Elie Dolgin: [\"The Myopia Boom. Short-Sightedness is Reaching Epidemic Proportions.

With the computer all these activities were combined and needed no change of posture or vision of the user from his desktop. It certainly improved the quality of the work and efficiency but caused ocular problems, such as dry eye, redness, irritation, eye strain, tired eyes, temporary blurred vision, light sensitivity and muscular problems that stem from using a computer. All these symptoms collectively referred to as computer vision syndrome, which comprised of ocular surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms and/or extra-ocular (ergonomic) aetiologies due to improper posture such as neck and upper back pain and headache.    \nThe major contributors to CVS is thought to be the dry eye, the visual effects of video display terminals (VDT) such as lighting, glare, display quality, refresh rates and radiation and positioning of computer monitors.     \n<sub>[Saman Wimalasundera: \"Computer vision syndrome\", Galle Medical Journal, Vol 11: No. 1, September 2006.][5]</sub>\n\nSince now we have [Millions at risk of computer vision syndrome][6] it seems quite easy to refer to this simplified risk hierarchy: no reading, paper reading, screen reading. But it should be clear that this problem is indeed one that can be mitigated with adhering to proper ergonomic principles. Apart from the behaviour a user/reader might adapt, such as variation in distance, breaks, body posture, the different sources \u2013 or better surfaces \u2013 of reading material should be watched out for. A high gloss magazine read on a sunny beach might be quite stressful for the eyes whereas an ergonomic, non-glare, high resolution display might fare quite a bit better.\n\n> Significant eye symptoms relate to VDU use often occur and should not be underestimated. The increasing use of electronic devices with flat-panel display should prompt users to take appropriate measures to prevent or to relieve the eye symptoms arising from their use.     \n><sub>[Esteban Porcar et al.: \"Visual and ocular effects from the use of flat-panel displays\", Int J Ophthalmol. 2016; 9(6): 881\u2013885.][7] doi:10.18240/ijo.2016.06.16</sub>\n\n\nWhile these ergonomics were theoretically known for a long time and the progressivists promised a brighter future (pun intended):\n> Most people now have some contact with computers either at work or at home.

Improvements in display technologies continue apace and the next generation of displays will produce images of equivalent quality to typeset hardcopy. Speech recognition and synthesis are already available and this and other technologies are likely to reduce the visual demands of interacting with a computer.    \nIn the meantime, solving the problems of individual users requires a holistic approach, taking account of workstation design, workpractices and psychological factors as well as optometric data.     \n><sub>[W.DavidThomson: \"Eye problems and visual display terminals\u2014the facts and the fallacies\", Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics, Volume 18, Issue 2, March 1998, Pages 111-119][8]</sub>\n\nit seems that neither consumers nor some vendors and producers seem to really care.

As early as in 1835 Robert J. Graves described that ladies affected by goitre and palpitations (probably due to hyperthyroidism resulting from the disease which is now named after him) were remarkably thin [2]. Five years later the German physician Karl von Basedow described the same condition, where a lady suffering from goitre, Exophthalmos and palpitations had severely emaciated [3]. In 1883 the swiss surgeon Theodor Kocher described weight gain after total thyroidectomy [4]. Ten years later, in 1893 William Ord described rapid weight loss, after myxoedematous patients were set on treatment with thyroid extreact [5].\n\nToday it is known that over one third of hypothyroid infants have a birth weight greater than the ninetieth percentile [6, 7]. However, an \u201catypical\u201d form of hypothyroidism may be associated to low birth weight [8]. Of course, weight gain in hypothyroidism isn\u2019t restricted to infants, but common in adults, too. Hypothyroidism is assumed to contribute 2.5 to 5 kg (5 to 10 pounds) to body weight [9]. \n\nOn the other hand, changes in body weight may also result in changes of thyroid function. A number of studies, as recently extensively reviewed [10, 11], described elevated TSH levels and increased total step-up deiodinase activity in patients with weight gain. These changes were reversible after weight loss [12]. On the other hand, low T3 syndrome is a well-known consequence of anorexia and starvation [13, 14].\n\nProbably, these changes represent adaptive responses of pituitary-thyroid axis to type 1 or type 2 allostasis, respectively [15]. The observed mechanisms may contribute to some kind of autoregulation of weight in conditions of changing supply with energy.\n\n[![Autoregulation of weight in obesity [Chatzitomaris et al. 2017, CC BY license]][1]][1]\n\nTo use thyroid hormones as an adjunct treatment in obesity is strongly discouraged, since cardiovascular side effects may be significant [16].\n\n**References**\n\n1: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2017.00163/full\n\n2: Graves RT.

Claiming you have insight into the nature of reality will not be called psychosis if one displays minimal or no impairment, and if you can convince others that what you're experiencing is a reality of a *type* they are willing to entertain as existing. Even still, the presence of unpleasantness/impairment need to necessarily translate into a label of pathology.\n\nFrom [\"Dark nights of the soul\": Phenomenology and neurocognition of spiritual suffering in mysticism and psychosis][5]:\n\n\n\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\n\nThe similarity between psychosis and mysticism is an elephant in the room for religion and psychiatry. It's as though when they carved up their dominion over aspects of reality, psychiatry had to make some concessions. From DSM-V:\n\n[![enter image description here][7]][7]\n\n\nAnd of the experience itself, this is a description from Dostoevsky's *The Idiot (1868)*, detailing what we would characterise as a mystical experience associated with epilepsy:\n\n> For several instants I experience a happiness that is impossible in an\n> ordinary state, and of which other people have no conception. I feel\n> full harmony in myself and in the whole world, and the feeling is so\n> strong and sweet that for a few seconds of such bliss one could give\n> up ten years of life, perhaps all of life.\n> \n> I felt that heaven descended to earth and swallowed me.  I really\n> attained god and was imbued with him.  All of you healthy people don't\n> even suspect  what happiness is, that happiness that we epileptics\n> experience for a second before an attack.\n\n\n  [1]: https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/34/2/381/1923247\n  [2]: https://doi.org/10.1053/comp.2003.50017\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/89qNd.png\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/okxa5.png\n  [5]: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-13101-001\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGp9g.png\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cu1A7.png", "15254": "Individual studies often contradict each other.

There are scientific reasons and treatments involving worms and allergies or other immune system disorders. But the results are not overly conclusive and still understudied.\n\nThis is based on the so called [hygiene hypothesis][1] in immunology.\n\nShort version to this: our immune system evolved in a world full of dirt and germs  where it had to be quite aggressive against all those threats and invasions in order to keep  our ancestors alive. In recent years \u2013 since Leuwenhoek, Semmelweiss, Lister, Koch and Pasteur \u2013 we learned that and how germs could make us ill and tried to eradicate all of them. Or at least keep them away from us as to limit the danger of getting infections. \n\n\nThat would theoretically translate into the very simple reasoning: Trying to eliminate all germs, or improving hygiene, ensures a much healthier population across the board. But the problem observed was that allergies were on the rise into previously unheard of dimensions despite the direct living environments getting cleaner and cleaner. That is, in modernised or Western societies allergies have become very widespread. In less developed nations the rise of allergies was seen as much less pronounced.\n\nThe hypothesis is now that a lack of actual threats and \"proper training\" is directing the immune system to attack otherwise rather benign substances (like pollen) or even the own tissues (auto-immune disorders). Turning this process from its head back to its feet again it was then tried whether a deliberate infestation with once very common hookworms might alleviate the symptoms of sufferers. And apparently it sometimes did. \n\nApart from currently being still *very* promising there are downsides to its applications. The effects seem to rely quite heavily on early childhood exposure and diminish with age. Having a worm is not much fun and of course, once the worms have \"modulated the immune system\" you have to get treatment to get rid of them again (which might cause an impressive range of side-effects on its own; [example][2]).\n\nAnd while overuse of certain hygienic agents, like disinfectants and antibiotics, are certainly a problem, cutting back radically on hygiene or even to introduce deliberate infections of any kind seem like an easy inference \u2013 and a bat droppings crazy stupid one on top. It's complicated and we're still figuring out much of the basics. \n\nGood overviews are presented here: [Worm therapy. Why parasites may be good for you][3] and [Health by Hookworm][4] and [Gut instinct: the miracle of the parasitic hookworm][5].\n\nAlthough there were early speculations about this coming from Russian fringe doctors many decades ago and emerging in Western science in the seventies, the hypothesis really came into form with [Hay fever, hygiene, and household size][6] and took off after German reunification provided a really large quasi-experimental corroboration for it.\n\nAnother word for this is [helminthic therapy][7]. This whole concept is now even largely superseded (or [refined][8]?) with the [Old Friends hypothesis][9], including bacteria and even viruses. This presents a much more *re*-balanced view of \"us\"\u2013 taking for example also our whole microbiome into consideration and not just a few \"key players\" like the hookworm in question.\n\n\nMore up-to-date and in a more scientifically constructed wording than the gross oversimplifications above are these papers:\n\n[Interactions between helminth parasites and allergy][10](2009)\n> Helminth infections have strong modulatory effects on anti-parasite inflammatory responses in the human host but it is not clear if helminths can affect allergic inflammatory responses to aero-allergens. Helminth infections have been associated with both a reduced prevalence and increased prevalence of atopy and atopic disease in different populations. The immune regulatory effects of tissue helminths are likely to be stronger than those of geo-helminths. Further research in prospective observational and intervention studies is required to address the question of causality. An understanding of the mechanisms by which helminth parasites modulate the host allergic inflammatory response may lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory interventions. The demonstration of a causal association between some helminth parasites (particularly geo-helminths and toxocariasis that have a worldwide distribution) and an increased risk of asthma could lead to anthelmintic treatment programmes in populations considered to be at high risk.\n\n[The Hygiene Hypothesis and Its Inconvenient Truths about Helminth Infections][11](2016)\n> Current iterations of the hygiene hypothesis suggest an adaptive role for helminth parasites in shaping the proper maturation of the immune system. However, aspects of this hypothesis are based on assumptions that may not fully account for realities about human helminth infections. Such realities include evidence of causal associations between helminth infections and asthma or inflammatory bowel disease as well as the fact that helminth infections remain widespread in the United States, especially among populations at greatest risk for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\n\nThat means that the parasites are well known to be able to modulate the immune system response. But this does not translate into proven, always beneficial effects. It can also go very wrong and actually worsen any associated condition. We do not know with certainty how the parasites do it. We do not know with certainty which parasites might be good or bad for what. We do not know with certainty if early exposure (at a young age), where the observed effects seem strongest, is necessary and therefor a treatment for adults much less effective. Having parasites is not very pleasant, just copying their mechanism looks much more promising.\n\n> A recently emerged attractive alternative hypothesis to explain the rise of inflammatory diseases is a [\u201cbiome depletion\u201d theory][12]. This suggests inflammatory disease may be due to a loss of species diversity or alteration of composition of the commensal microbiome within the human body. \n>\n>The immense conflicting data regarding the benefits versus harms of live helminths as a therapeutic modality to date warrants further questioning of the utility of additional human clinical trials. Therefore, directing future research and trials towards helminth-derived immunomodulatory molecules allows for safer and better-described therapies that could alleviate the suffering from autoimmune conditions without the commensurate risk of a parasite infection. Indeed, the aim of experimental animal models should be to develop novel treatments that mimic the effects of helminths without requiring the presence of parasites in the host.\n\n[Human helminth therapy to treat inflammatory disorders \u2013 where do we stand?][13] (2015)\n> Parasitic helminths have evolved together with the mammalian immune system over many millennia and as such they have become remarkably efficient modulators in order to promote their own survival. Their ability to alter and/or suppress immune responses could be beneficial to the host by helping control excessive inflammatory responses and animal models and pre-clinical trials have all suggested a beneficial effect of helminth infections on inflammatory bowel conditions, MS, asthma and atopy. Thus, helminth therapy has been suggested as a possible treatment method for autoimmune and other inflammatory disorders in humans.\n\nEspecially in relation to asthma: \n[Asthma & Helminthic Therapy.

Researchers at the University of Southern California presented a study that explained that refraining from food for as little as two days can regenerate the immune system, and in addition, fasting for two to four days helps the body to fight infection and \u201cflips a regenerative switch\u201d that triggers stem cell-based regeneration of new white blood cells, thereby renewing the body\u2019s defense system. During the fast, the body gets rid of the parts of the system that might be damaged or old, the inefficient parts. The scientists believe that even if you start with a system heavily damaged by chemotherapy or aging, fasting cycles can generate an entirely new immune system.  In a small pilot clinical trial researchers found that fasting for a 72-hour period prior to chemotherapy protected patients against toxicity. Fasting also affects the levels of a substance in our bodies called IGF -1 and in reducing this it diminishes tumour growth and the risk of developing cancers.</sub><br><br>\n> So, how does water-only fasting actually work? What is going on in the body?\n\n> <sub>Water-only fasting \u2013 as the name suggests is where you only drink water and take no food whatsoever and, most importantly, you must take complete bed rest.  The truly therapeutic part of the fast does not actually begin until the second or third day: the reason for this is that during the first 24 - 48 hours after starting a water fast, the body is still burning off circulating blood sugar and also sugar stored in the muscles and liver in the form of glycogen. Once the first two to three days of the fast are over, your body then begins to burn fat tissue for fuel. Next, molecules named ketones begin circulating in the blood. Ketones suppress hunger and this is why fasting is not a difficult process \u2013 once you are over the first few days.\n\n> <sub> Many people don\u2019t understand the process of ketosis correctly and fear that this could damage the kidney and brain, possibly leading to loss of consciousness and even more dire consequences. However, a group of \u2018hygienic physicians\u2019 as doctors working in this field are known (and which includes Dr Sabatino as one of the leaders in the field), have supervised many thousands of fasts over the past 50 years, and have shown these concerns to be unfounded. In fact, when fasting is undertaken in a supportive environment, with the supervising practitioner ensuring proper hydration, and total resting conditions, kidney and heart function often dramatically improve as weight and blood pressure drop. There is often a dramatic improvement in the acuity of special senses, vision, hearing etc. People wearing glasses will sometimes remark how they experience moments of absolutely perfect eyesight without their glasses.</sub>\n</sub>\n\n\"Researchers found out\": without a link to the original study, not even a date on the article cited above, that is very poor reporting and avoids being checked for accuracy. A very poor practice. Apart from some valid information, and relying on unsourced and probably preliminary scientific evidence, and using impressive sounding abbreviations, there is also the corresponding bull**** mixed under (e.g. \"fasting cycles can generate an entirely new immune system\").\n\nBut are there studies that might confirm these alleged findings? A more reliable source for this claim is presented in a very accessible article here:\n\n> [**Feed Or Starve A Sickness? It Depends On The Infection:**][2]\n> To investigate how loss of appetite might affect the immune system in sick animals, researchers infected some mice with the bacteria Listeria (a common cause of food poisoning), and some with the influenza virus.<br>\n> When the mice were force fed, those with bacterial infections died\u2014but those with viral infections were more likely to survive. The researchers determined that glucose in food was responsible for these divergent fates (rather than proteins or fats). When the team used drugs to block the mice from using glucose, the mice infected with bacteria survived, while their virus-ridden peers died.<br>\n>Viral and bacterial infections induce different types of immune responses. So our metabolism might require different fuels to prevent inflammation from damaging the body. During a viral infection, glucose seems to be key. But during a bacterial infection, fasting benefited the mice by allowing them to use ketones, a different fuel that is produced when fat is broken down.\n\nThat indicates an important finding that *might* have very profound effects in the future. But the cited article is sensible enough to also state clearly:\n> But it\u2019s definitely too soon for these findings to translate into advice about how sick people should eat. This study focused on one strain of mice in a lab setting and only a couple of forms of infection. \u201cIt remains to be seen how these results apply to critical illness in humans,\u201d Medzhitov and his coauthors wrote.\n\nThe original research article is published here: \n[**Opposing Effects of Fasting Metabolism on Tissue Tolerance in Bacterial and Viral Inflammation (2016)][3].**\n\nTo repeat, in there is the important caveat to note:\n> One limitation of this study (common to most animal studies) is that it was performed on a single mouse strain (C57BL/6J) in one mouse facility. Thus, the roles of genetic background and facility-specific environment remain unknown. In addition, there are many caveats with extrapolating data on organismal biology from studies in unnatural settings of animal facilities. [\u2026] Finally, it remains to be seen how these results apply to critical illness in humans.\n\nFurther studies at least confirm that there are some interesting changes related to the modulation of immune system responses while fasting:<br> \n> [**Fasting metabolism modulates the interleukin-12/interleukin-10 cytokine axis (2017):**][4]\n> [\u2026]  Growing evidence indicates that metabolic processes impact both, innate and adaptive immunity. [\u2026] In conclusion, we showed that fasting metabolism modulates the IL-12/IL-10 cytokine balance, establishing novel targets for metabolism-based immune-modulation.\n\n\nSo, sadly, we still do not know for sure. \n\nGeneral problems to simply saying \"it works\" are summarised here:\n\n> [**Calorie restriction in rodents: Caveats to consider (2017):**][5]\n> The calorie restriction paradigm has provided one of the most widely used and most useful tools for investigating mechanisms of aging and longevity. By far, rodent models have been employed most often in these endeavors. Over decades of investigation, claims have been made that the paradigm produces the most robust demonstration that aging is malleable. In the current review of the rodent literature, we present arguments that question the robustness of the paradigm to increase lifespan and healthspan. Specifically, there are several questions to consider as follows:<br> \n> \n> \n> 1. At what age does CR no longer produce benefits?\n> 2. Does CR attenuate cognitive decline? \n> \n> 3. **Are there negative effects of CR, including effects on bone health, wound healing, and response to infection?** \n> \n> 4. How important is schedule of feeding? \n> 5. How long does CR need to be imposed to be effective? \n> 6. How do genotype and gender influence CR? \n> 7. What role does dietary composition play?\n> \n> Consideration of these questions produce many caveats that should guide future investigations to move the field forward.\n\nTo compare these findings in animals with how humans will react to fasting while infected, a general overview of fasting across different species might be useful and is  documented here:<br>\n[Marshall D.

Only for heat delivery they [currently feature as \"doesn't hurt, may help, increases comfort and well being\" for physician guidelines for lower back pain.][2]\n\nFor the primary effect they are intended to deliver there might be even more convincing findings behind them:\n\n> [When heat over 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) is applied to the skin, heat receptors deeper down, where the pain is, are switched on. The heat receptors in turn block the effect of chemical messengers that cause pain to be detected by the body][3].<br>\n> Specifically, King and his colleagues discovered that a heat receptor called TRPV1 can block P2X3 pain receptors.\n\n\n\n\n**The filling of these bags or pillows actually does matter for a variety of reasons.**\n\nIn the past they were most [popularly][4] filled with [simple][1] grains like wheat, rice or barley. [This provides][5] a nice and even, down-weighing sensation of heat. But these are problematic because of their moisture content and inherent instability. They break down and dehusk, releasing [harmful dust and particles][6]. \n\nIf used in this way they also tend to rot and mould quickly. Also [the][7] [allergenic][8] [potential][9] of the ingredients is concerning. This is another reason for not using them to apply cold: moulding will be even quicker then. For a quick make-shift heat applicator they might still be an option, just discard them after some very few uses to make sure.\n\nCherry pits seem less problematic in both regards, being described as a much \"drier heat\" but they too [can][10] be [quite][11] a [surprising fire hazard][12] when brought to [heat in a microwave][13]. \n\nFrom the [manufacturer][14] of a cherry stone pillow sold as medical equipment:\n>  Attention: Important safety information:<br>\n\n>- Please do observe the specified heating instructions.

But when using it for delivering heat they obviously can relase volatile substances like essential oils which can have a variety of effects. Adding [lavender][16] flowers will smell beautifully and calm you down. However, all those additives I saw added to these pillows substantially increase the mould, allergy and fire hazards. If they are known or even just suspect to be effective and wanted it's probably best to use them isolated. \n\n\nSo, yes: the content of the bags does matter quite a bit. Using hard and dry kernels \u2013 like cherry pits or grape seeds \u2013 seems as good as using just pure sand; and both are better than grains or colourful mixtures of sometimes dubious effect.\n\n\n  [1]: https://sew4home.com/tips-resources/sewing-tips-tricks/organic-fillers-warming-pads-we-compare-rice-corn-and-flaxseed\n  [2]: http://www.leitlinien.de/nvl/html/kreuzschmerz/kapitel-5\n  [3]: https://www.livescience.com/890-study-heating-pads-relieve-internal-pain.html\n  [4]: http://tipnut.com/make-your-own-microwave-heating-pad/\n  [5]: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130417091648.htm\n  [6]: https://familydoctor.org/condition/occupational-respiratory-disease/?adfree=true\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12669902\n  [8]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11957384\n  [9]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5365019\n  [10]: https://www.aerztezeitung.de/panorama/article/588757/heisses-koernerkissen-setzt-bett-brand.html\n  [11]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/10638872/Alert-over-dangers-of-wheat-bags-after-pensioner-dies.html\n  [12]: https://www.productsafety.gov.au/news/wheat-bag-fire-hazards\n  [13]: https://www.choice.com.au/home-and-living/heating/home-heating/articles/heat-wheat-bag-danger-and-new-voluntary-standard-140616\n  [14]: http://mitrade.in/product/cherry-stone-pillow-for-adults/\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16856441\n  [16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_oil", "14297": "[Myopia](https://nei.nih.gov/health/errors/myopia), or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye grows too long from front to back. According to the [American Optometric Association](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/myopia),\n\n> Myopia occurs if the eyeball is too long or the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is too curved. As a result, the light entering the eye isn't focused correctly, and distant objects look blurred.\n\nInstead of focusing images on the [retina](https://www.britannica.com/science/retina), the [lens](https://www.britannica.com/science/lens-eye-structure) of the eye focuses the image in front of the retina. In a normal eye, the light focuses on the retina. However, in individuals with myopia, the eyeball is too long and focuses light in front of the retina.\u00a0\n\nAlthough genetics plays a major role in the development of myopia, it's development may also be affected by how an individual uses their eyes. For example, individuals who spend a considerable amount of time doing near-work such as reading, writing, and working on a computer have an increased risk of developing myopia. Although it primarily presents in school-aged children, adults may also develop the condition as a result of visual stress or as a complication of another health condition such as diabetes.\n\n**Can myopia reversible, naturally or through medication?**\n\nAlthough a cure for nearsightedness has yet to be discovered, several studies suggest it may be possible to at least control myopia by *slowing its progression*.\n\nAn article published by the American Academy of Ophthalmology: \u2018[Eye Drops That Can Slow Down Nearsightedness in Children](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/eye-drops-nearsighted-children)\u2019 references a [clinical trial on atropine](https://www.aao.org/assets/28fe020e-5f93-4d06-aac1-889cecb15fb2/635835505202800000/atropine-for-myopia-5-yr-clinical-trial-ophthalmology-2015-pdf?inline=1) which was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of different concentrations of atropine eye drops for the control of myopia progression. Results of the five-year trial indicate that **a low concentration of atropine drops could potentially be an effective treatment for myopia**.\n\n> In a five-year clinical trial, investigators there showed that **0.01 percent atropine drops safely slowed down the progression of myopia by about 50 percent** with almost no side effects.\n\n'[The Safety of Orthokeratology - A Systematic Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697954/)' evaluates the ocular safety of orthokeratology (also known as Ortho-K or OK) for the treatment of myopia.\n\n> There is sufficient evidence to suggest that **OrthoK is a safe option for myopia correction** and retardation. Long-term success of OrthoK treatment requires a combination of proper lens fitting, rigorous compliance to lens care regimen, good adherence to routine follow-ups, and timely treatment of complications.\n\nAnother study analyzes the efficacy of atropine eye drops and orthokeratology lenses in controlling myopia progression and elongation of axial length. \u2019[Overnight orthokeratology is comparable with atropine controlling myopia](https://bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2415-14-40),' a retrospective study, included **105 patients (210 eyes) who wore OK lenses** and **105 patients (210 eyes) who applied 0.125% atropine** every night during the 3 following period.\n\n> The change in axial length per year was 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0mm, 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u00a0mm, and 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\u00a0mm in the OK lens group, and 0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u00a0mm, 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u00a0mm, and 0.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0mm in the atropine group for years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed an increase in myopia of 0.28 D and 0.34 D per year, and an increase in axial length of 0.28\u00a0mm and 0.37\u00a0mm per year in the OK lens and atropine groups, respectively. Repeated measure ANOVA showed significant differences in myopia (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and axial length (p\u2009<\u20090.001) between the atropine and OK lens groups; in astigmatism, there was no significant difference in these parameters (p\u2009=\u20090.320). \n\nComparison of increases in axial length in relation to baseline myopia showed significant correlations both in the OK lens group and atropine group. \n\n> High myopia patients benefited more from both OK lenses and atropine than did low myopia patients. The correlation of baseline myopia and myopia progression was stronger in the OK lens group than in the atropine group.\n\nResults of the study reveal that the **OK lens is a useful method for controlling myopia progression** even in [high myopia](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/ask-ophthalmologist-q/high-myopia) patients.   \n\nIn conclusion, although myopia cannot be reversed (yet), several studies concur that it is possible to control or slow the progression of nearsightedness. ", "14134": "[Biotin][1] is an [important][2] nutrient. [Biotin][3] [deficiency][4] was at least [thought][5] to be very rare. Unless the diet was for the [main part][6] composed of raw egg white it was assumed to be only of concern in certain subgroups like severely malnourished children. [But deficiency might actually be much more widespread:][7]\n\n> The importance of biotin for human health has been under-appreciated for many years. Health professionals thought that the role of biotin in human well-being was limited to that as a coenzyme for carboxylases and that biotin deficiency was fairly rare in free-living humans. This view has changed considerably over the past few years. Evidence has been provided that [marginal][8] biotin deficiency might be more common than widely believed, particularly in certain subgroups of the general population, such as pregnant women, patients treated with certain drugs and severely malnourished children. \n\n\nThe component responsible for this phenomenon is the substance [avidin][9] that is an [antinutrient][10] and biotin binding substances are mostly  found in the white but also the [yolk][11] for humans since the binding produced by the biotin and avidin is apparently stronger than digestive juices.\n\nAvidin is glyco-proein that binds to any biotin so consuming egg yolk does not \"negate\" that. Egg yolk does not contain anything that reverses or prevents this bond. Biotin  of any source, for example synthesised by gut bacteria, is subject to being captured by consumed avidin. Eating a lot of [egg white][12] means [one][13] has to eat that much [more biotin][14], that conveniently is also present in the yolk \u2013 to compensate for the losses due to [avidin][15] consumption. \n\nTo really develop clinical manifestations of [biotin deficiency][16] it usually might take a while. But consuming lots of raw egg white seems to be not a very good idea.\n\nAlthough the following mentions pets and the effect of denaturation on avidin by cooking seems under debate now, this paragraph illustrates it well:\n> [A syndrome termed \u201cegg white injury\u201d was first described in the 1920s. Animals fed raw egg whites as a component of their food developed a scaly skin rash, elevated blood cholesterol levels, and defects in nerve transmission. Eventually, the underlying cause was identified as a deficiency of biotin, brought about by an inhibitory substance in egg white that decreased availability of biotin. This factor was named \u201cavid-albumin\u201d or avidin. Avidin is a protein that is a secretory product of the hen\u2019s oviduct and is subsequently deposited in the albuminous portion of the egg. When consumed, avidin combines with dietary biotin in the intestine and prevents its absorption. The avidin in egg white is so effective in this capacity that raw egg white has been used to experimentally induce biotin deficiency in laboratory animals. Regardless, the danger of a pet owner inducing a biotin deficiency in a dog or cat by feeding supplemental eggs is slight because the yolk of the egg contains large quantities of biotin. In addition, cooking eggs denatures avidin and destroys its biotin binding ability. Practically speaking, potential risk for biotin deficiency will only occur if an owner supplements the pet\u2019s food with only the white of the raw egg. As in other species, signs of biotin deficiency in dogs and cats include dermatitis, loss of hair and poor growth rate.][17]\n\n\n  [1]: http://physrev.physiology.org/content/33/4/560.short\n  [2]: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/biotin\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin_deficiency\n  [5]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23183297\n  [6]: https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jas/abstracts/5/2/JAN0050020219\n  [7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726758/\n  [8]: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/2/295.short\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidin\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient\n  [11]: http://www.biochemj.org/content/157/2/395\n  [12]: https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.93.2420.477\n  [13]: https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/44868\n  [14]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450323/\n  [15]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/avidin\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10075337\n  [17]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032306619810026X", "13563": "That product is marketed boldly as \"Special formula designed to bring sensual waves of warming, cooling or tingling sensations.

Looking through the consumer [reviews][1]<sup>1</sup> on various sites gives mixed results, at best. Many negative [experiences][2] are reported (even on commercial sites selling it).

[Long list of concerns.][7] Reduces barrier function of the skin. Thereby providing synergistic effects with other ingredients. [Codecheck][8] label: \"slightly questionable\". <br>\nMost likely candidate for *the* \"active ingredient\".

Additionally this substance was often found to have concerning levels of very harmful impurities. Unsafe on damaged skin. Codecheck label: \"questionable\"\n\n- Aroma ([Fragrance][13], Flavour): Under current law this may contain a mix of anything from essential oils to other highly active substances. [This is a legal loophole][14]: anything *declared* to be only for smell and flavour can fall under this label [since only 26 substances have to be listed specifically.][15] The list of ingredients is sorted by weight and Aroma features pretty high on it. Codecheck label: \"not classifiable\"\n\n- [Benzoic Acid:][16] Preservative that is restricted for use in cosmetics in Japan. May have [hormone-like effects][17] and can be an [irritant or allergen.][18] Codecheck label: \"slightly questionable\"\n\n\nSumming this up: unless the manufacturer opens its playbook and explains what is there to do what, this is probably a moderately unhealthy, slightly irritating lube. Together with its advertising framing this seems to be mostly a mind thing if received as pleasurable ([a concept not totally unheard of][19]).

Samples of breast milk and blood were obtained simultaneously over a 34-hour period beginning just prior to the first dose of ibuprofen. Gas-liquid chromatography assay methodology capable of detecting 1 \u03bcg/ml was used to determine concentrations of ibuprofen in serum and breast milk. Ibuprofen was present in the serum with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours. No measurable amounts of ibuprofen were found in the samples of breast milk. **The conclusion drawn is that, in lactating women who take up to 400 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours, less than 1 mg of ibuprofen per day is excreted in breast milk.**][4]\n\nAnd reach the following conclusions:\n\n> [Because of its extremely low levels in breastmilk, short half-life and safe use in infants in doses much higher than those excreted in breastmilk, ibuprofen is a preferred choice as an analgesic or antiinflammatory agent in nursing mothers.][5]\n\nThese conclusions are in generalised form:\n> [According to our review, AMDs [anti-migraine drugs] safe during breastfeeding are as follows: low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ibuprofen, sumatriptan, metoprolol, propranolol, verapamil, amitriptyline, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, acetaminophen, caffeine, and metoclopramide. AMDs compatible with breastfeeding but warranting caution are as follows: diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, most new triptans, topiramate, valproate, venlafaxine, and cyproheptadine. Finally, high-dose ASA, atenolol, nadolol, cinnarizine, flunarizine, ergotamine, methysergide, and pizotifen are contraindicated.][6]\n\n\n\nBut what now about the sleepy baby at hand? Babies are just sleepy in general and after feeding especially:\n> - [ My baby falls asleep while nursing. What can I do?<br>\nNewborns often fall asleep at the breast, especially after feeling satisfied from a good feeding.][7] \n\nThis is completely normal:\n> [Breastfeeding and sleep often overlap in the early weeks, when your baby spends more time asleep than awake.

No sun (low vitamin D), no excercise (no bone growth stimulus). Without adequate vitamin D levels, the Ca in the milk (although in principle bioavailable) is not even absorbed in the gut. Even if it were (or: even the little that is) is not used for net new bone growth as the excercise stimulus is missing. With a high protein diet (or, a diet causing excess acid urinary excretion), Ca is lost. It may have been lost even without a high protein diet because of bone loss due to lack of excercise. Or, with a low excess acid diet, bone would have been maintained even with the low level of excercise.  \n\n- On the other hand, consider a physically active outdoors person. Excercise gives a bone growth stimulus, sunlight does its share in supplying\u00a0vitamin D. In that scenario, milk gives the protein as well as the Ca to actually grow bone. Result is a net gain in Ca, even though some Ca is excreted via urine.\n\n*Slightly off topic: this whole scenario feels a bit like a 101 in how to lie with statistics without actually lying: we have at least 4-5 factors that need to be at the right setting (and for 4 of them it is comparatively easy to be off) in order to achieve bone growth/net Ca gain. Now any study looking at a single factor will not find an effect unless they make sure all other factors are right. And if one factor is worse with the treatment group than the controls, a study may even seem to observe the opposite of what is really going on.*\n\n \n---\n\nI tried to find numbers for Ca\u00b2\u207a excretion per gram of protein. A rough guesstimate based on http://jn.nutrition.org/content/128/6/1051.full would be up to 200 mg Ca\u00b2\u207a urinary excretion for 150 g of protein consumption. Based on that rough guesstimate, food with a ratio > 1.33 mg Ca/g of protein would be considered as \"gaining Ca\u00b2\u207a\". \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk#Nutrition_and_health gives cow milk with 30 - 35 g protein / l and 1200 mg Ca\u00b2\u207a/l, yielding a Ca : protein ratio of > 30 mg Ca/g of protein. Even assuming just the average absorption rate for Ca in food of 30 % (http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/4/783.extract - didn't find numbers for milk, though it is frequently cited as highly bioavailable - but then it will also depend on other factors) that leaves almost an order of magnitude to the side of more Ca uptake than increase in excretion. \n\nSo overall, this **back-of-the-envelope calculation is in favor of milk being a net source of Ca**. Note however, that not all dairy products have the same Ca:protein ratio as milk. E.g. [Whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey) has even more Ca:protein, and consequently the cheese of which whey is a leftover/side product has a somewhat lower Ca:protein ratio. \n\n\n\n", "13579": "It was not specified what kind of \"trip\" is planned.

I will answer with one example, there are others.\n\nImmunotherapy gets the patient's own immune system to destroy the tumours rather than the treatment itself destroying them. This might involve making the immune system more active, or interfering with the way that tumours hide or shield themselves from the immune system. For example, Wikipedia says of [Ipilimumab][1]\n\n>T lymphocytes can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, an inhibitory mechanism interrupts this destruction. Ipilimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows the lymphocytes to continue to destroy cancer cells.\n\n(Lymphocytes are your own white blood cells, the same mechanism that cleans up infections in your body all the time.)\n\nThis [article][2] at cancer.gov summarizes some studies showing how Ipilimumab and other immunotherapies are changing outcomes for melanoma. You can do you own searches for other drugs and other cancers. For example Nivolumab is combined with \"ipi\" for melanoma. I have also seen ads on tv for Nivolumab for lung cancer.\n\nHow much longer will patients live? That depends on the cancer. Melanoma has dismal outcomes if it's Stage IV - median survival of about 6 months, less than 10% surviving 5 years - and chemotherapy doesn't help survival. (One [article][3] on how bad stage IV is with traditional treatments.)  So there's plenty of room for improvement. The studies in the article above include some of that improvement. It's hard to find much on long-term odds, because they haven't been using these drugs long - ten years at most. \n\nWhy not use it everywhere? Well they literally do not know what cancers it works for (presumably not all of them) or precisely what kind of survival improvements to expect. It's a no-brainer to use it with something that has survival times of just a few months, but should you use it with something that has survival times of 2 or 3 years? Because there is a cost. First, a dollar-cost: $200,000 a year is typical. And second, the side effects are very bad. They can be fatal. And when they're not fatal, they're hospitalize-you-and-major-steroids bad, and take-a-compensating-medication-for-the-rest-of-your-life bad. The immune system can over-react causing inflammation and swelling that might damage or destroy your thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, or whatnot, or give you colitis. Understanding the side effects is a big part of the current studies. One [study][4] describing how people went from months of survival to years mentions \"55% of patients will have high-grade adverse events\" so widespread use will be held back by that.\n\nHere's a [study][5] I'm very familiar with. It compares two dose regimens of two different immunotherapy drugs for melanoma. These regimens have already been shown to have the same response rate; the study compares the side effects. It's normal for some patients to have to stop taking the treatment because the side effects are intolerable. And a similar [study][6] (same combination of drugs, same disease) reported results where over 60% of patients getting the combination were still alive after 2 years. 65% is so much better than 10%!\n\nThere are other immunotherapy drugs, but in general you see:\n\n- the treatment doesn't attack the cancer; rather it enables the patients own immune system to do so\n- the improvements in survival are astonishing. People living years instead of months, and possibly decades instead of months. People becoming immediately \"better\" with no symptoms instead of lingering with constant side effects of chemo and radiation, or surgeries many times a year\n- the long term outcomes are not well known at all\n- the side effects are very dangerous when they happen\n- the cost is high\n\nFrom a personal point of view, yesterday I said to my doctor \"it feels like being around when insulin or antibiotics were first being used\" and he agreed, yes it does.

Also, for most of the priapism cases, the reporter indicated that the patient had recovered or was recovering without sequelae at the time of the report.\" `[v]`\n\n2) In another sildenafil research study `[vi]` 15% of the men reported \"recovery of spontaneous erection\" after taking the medicine for a limited period of time. (They subsequently stopped taking sildenafil and continued to enjoy normal erectile function.) In this instance, the authors are using 'spontaneous' in the sense of a 'natural process', which I recognize is not exactly what we're talking about here, but I wanted to mention it for completeness. \n___\n###Footnotes\n\n*i.* \"spontaneous.\" *Random House Kernerman Webster\u2019s College Dictionary.* 2010.

Several BMR equations exist but the most notable one was the [Harris-Benedict equation][1] (revised 1984), which was created in 1919 and was the 'best' until 1990 until [The Mifflin St Jeor Equation][2].\n\nThese equations use the same factors:\n\n    P   is total heat production at complete rest,\n    m   is mass (kg),\n    h   is height (cm), and\n    a   is age (years)\n\nWhen investigation on the BRM of a pool of individuals was done there was a wide range of results for people who appeared to be similar. They realised these because formulas are based on body weight alone, which does not take into account the difference in metabolic activity between lean body mass and body fat they were getting variation in their results. \n\nBelow is a further breakdown of the BMR impact per-pound of different types of tissue. \n\n[Organ or tissue Daily metabolic rate][3] \n\n    Fat 2 calories per pound \n    Muscle 6 calories per pound \n    Liver 91 calories per pound \n    Brain 109 calories per pound \n    Heart 200 calories per pound \n    Kidneys 200 calories per pound \n\nOne can conclude for 2 individuals of the same weight, and different BMR's that it is likely that their muscle/fat ratio is not equal.\n\nAn important point to note is that in all research all muscle mass is treated equally, biology dictates that muscle only has size and the ability for that muscle to be fully recruited to move weight is down to the adaptions that the muscle has gone through. Body builders utilise the principles of time-unter-tension to increase volume and to achieve this they often do not train for maximal lifts. The opposite is true for powerlifters and to a greater extent, strongmen who to train their bodies to perform maximal lifts and thus are 'stronger'.\n\nThe quote from elite fitness is just looking from a maximal lift percentage.

Take a look at it. Do you think you'd be able to successfully differentiate between a melanoma and a benign \"suspicious skin spot\" every single time? Now consider that melanoma is just one of many different types of skin cancer, and that skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer.<sup>[1][2]</sup>\n\nOne particular advantage we have in fighting this type of cancer is that it often comes with a warning sign, the \"suspicious skin spots\" you mention. And this is extraordinarily important in successfully fighting the disease. In 2014, 46% of skin cancer patients in England were diagnosed in stages III or IV, which often means death for the patients.

It can cause both serious acute and chronic effects. The severity of effects depends on several factors such as:\n\n - dose\n - length of exposure\n - frequency of exposure\n - exposure route\n - other toxic substances present\n - factors related to the exposed person (age, weight, physiological susceptibility) etc.\n\nCCl4 is toxic via all 3 routes of exposure (oral, dermal and inhalation) and can cause a range of detrimental effects, including (but not limited to):\n\n> Oral and inhalation exposure to high concentrations of carbon tetrachloride results in acute central nervous system effects including dizziness, vertigo, headache, depression, confusion, incoordination and, in severe cases, respiratory failure, coma and death. Gastrointestinal problems including **nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea**, often accompany these **narcotic effects**. **Liver and kidney damage** can appear after the acute symptoms subside. All symptoms can occur following a single oral or inhalation exposure. Milder narcotic effects followed by liver and kidney damage have been reported following dermal exposure. **Although an inhalation exposure of about 1000 ppm for a few minutes to hours will cause the narcotic effects in 100% of the population, large variations in sensitivity are seen.** Alcohol intake greatly increases human sensitivity to carbon tetrachloride; consequently, exposure to 250 ppm for 15 minutes can be life threatening to an alcoholic. \n\n(RAIS, emphasis mine)\n\nIt is also characterised as a group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans). There have been many epidemiological studies to confirm these effects, such as this one:\n\n> Ott et al. (1985) conducted a cohort mortality study of 1919 men employed for one or more  years  between  1940  and  1969  at  a  chemical manufacturing  facility  in  the  United States. This cohort included 226 workers assigned to a unit which produced chlorinated methanes (methyl chloride (see this volume), dichloromethane (see this volume), chloro-\nform (IARC, 1987b), and carbon tetrachloride) and, recently, tetrachloroethylene (IARC,1995). Exposure levels were not reported.[...]  There were **42 deaths observed among the 226 workers** (standardized\nmortality ratio (SMR), 0.6, based on national rates) [SMR, 0.8, based on company rates]. **Nine cancers were observed** [SMR, 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4\u20131.5, based on company rates], including three pancreatic cancers [SMR, 3.3; 95% CI, 0.7\u20139.7, based on company  rates].  **Two  of  the  three  workers  who  died  of  pancreatic  cancer  had  been employed for less than five years.**\n\n(from IARC, emphasis mine)\n\nFurthermore, it takes time for liver damage to be noticed. Even more so mid- 20th century, when the solvent was mostly used. Still, the toxicity of CCl4 is such, that it has been gradually replaced in dry cleaning from 1940s and 1950s and since 1960s it is no longer in use. The use of CCl4 as a pesticide was stopped in 1986. \n\nFinally, one can experience severe health damage without actually \"dropping dead\" . It took time (as many things in science do) to establish and prove the connection between CCl4 and its detrimental health effects, but once this was done the old ways from the old days were abandoned. \n\n______________________________________\nReferences:\n\n 1.

A review of current concepts][1]\"):\n\n> **The relationship between fluoride and tooth decay is complex and probably not yet fully understood.** However, it is known that fluoride interferes with the process of tooth decay in at least four ways: (1) If children ingest sufficient fluoride (...) up to 7 years of age the fluoride alters the structure of the developing enamel making it more resistant to acid attack. (2) (...) encourages remineralisation and ensures that the enamel crystals that are laid down are of improved quality. (...) low levels of fluoride in the mouth gradually improve the strength of the tooth enamel and its ability to resist acid attack. (3) (...) reducing the ability of the plaque bacteria to produce acid. **This is a major factor in the prevention of tooth decay.** (4) (...) if sufficient fluoride is ingested during childhood when the teeth are developing, it affects the depth of the fissures (grooves) on the biting surfaces of the teeth (...) thus reducing the ability of plaque to remain undisturbed.\n\nNow, let's analyze what is written above. Points (1) and (4) are important when you're a kid, they doesn't matter to you now. Point (2) is about improved self-repair and acid resistance. This is some very good property of fluoride, but it may not be so well understood and so effective as it is often presented. Quote from \"[Current concepts on the theories of the mechanism of action of fluoride.][2]\" (1999):\n\n> Comparative studies of fluoride efficacy have shown that higher concentrations in solution are needed in pH-cycling studies of dentine than in enamel to maintain the mineral balance or to induce remineralization. (...) future perspectives for fluoride applications should be found in the retention and slow release of fluoride after various combinations of fluoride treatment, the combination of fluoride and anti-microbial treatment, the individualization of caries prevention, and the combination of preventive schemes with new developments in caries diagnosis.\n\n(So this is not so simple just to have low levels of fluoride.)\n\nIf you sincerely keep good dental habits which include also proper diet and mouth washing, then you could rely on your natural remineralization. Keeping/restoring proper pH level would be important here. \nPoint (3) is about bacteria and here things can get tricky. Bacteria evolve and it is not impossible that they will learn to deal with fluoride. Quote from \"[New insight on the response of bacteria to fluoride.][3]\" (2012): \n\n> However, the precise effects that fluoride has on bacteria and the mechanisms that bacteria use to overcome fluoride toxicity have largely remained unexplored. Recently, my laboratory reported the discovery of biological systems that bacteria use to sense fluoride and reduce fluoride toxicity. \n\nActually, [some really bad-ass fluoride-resistant bacterias][4] are known to exist from a quite a long time now.\n\nIf you're not to use fluoride then again a lot will depend on your dental habits. If proper pH levels are maintained then \"good\" and \"bad\" bacteries in your mouth will keep themselves in some form of balance (hopefully).\n\nNow, I think that it is important to explain what is the main function of toothpaste and general toothbrushing: it's **mechanical surface abrasion**. This is nicely summarized [here][5]:\n\n> Toothpastes contain mild abrasives which physically scrub away the plaque and food debris without damaging the tooth enamel.\n\nThis, in essence, has nothing to do with fluoride.\n\nSo, in my opinion, you can use fluoride-free toothpaste. If you'll be careful with pH levels, do mouthwash, be careful what you eat, then your natural tooth decay prevention mechanisms should work. **But I don't guarantee anything**.\n\nAlso, if I was to use fluoride-free toothpaste, I would like know if there exist some alternative chemical substance of similar properties. I haven't checked that and this is good material for another question.\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1061590\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10777135\n  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327376\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8704659\n  [5]: http://www.thefactsabout.co.uk/how-does-toothpaste-work/content/115", "7188": "[Can fruit seeds and undigested plant residuals cause acute appendicitis][1]\n\n> The ratio of acute appendicitis caused by plants is minimal among all\n> appendectomised patients, but avoidence of eating undigested fruit\n> seeds and chewing plants well may help to prevent appendicitis.\n\nSo yes, eating habits can cause appendicitis, but it is minimal. This is partially due to some appendicitis's being caused by obstruction and the food particles can increase risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609170/?report=classic", "7048": "First of all, it's typically liver and the kidneys responsible for removing unwanted chemicals from the body, not the immune system. It should be noted that liver and kidneys **have no \"knowledge\" which chemical is \"bad\" and which is \"good\"**. They have evolved to let some chemicals pass, react some chemicals etc. But there is plethora of compounds that had so little influence on evolutionary process, that we're not ready to handle them, since not being able to handle them was not selected against in the process of evolution.\n\n > ### So can the body break down anything?\n\n**tl;dr: No, there are many chemical compounds that are not handled by human body ideally and that, even if there's enough time for the body to handle them, still cause major harm.**\n\nNot sure what breaking down exactly means here, but certainly there are some compounds that can get stuck in the body, notably heavy metals. Those and some others accumulate in the body, possibly but not necessarily causing harm in the future. Let's have some examples:\n\n## Bioaccumulation\nBioaccumulation is a process where organism (eg. you) absorbs certain chemical compound at faster rate than it excretes or processes it, which is probably what you meant by \"*breaking down*\". See bellow some examples of such accumulation. Remember that the compound to be accumulated doesn't need to be exactly toxic, but as the poison is in the dose, as long as you accumulate something, it eventually **will** became toxic, should it even be water.\n\n### Silver\nSilver is a heavy metal and was used as disinfection in the first half of 20th century<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>. Silver accumulates in the human body, causing [argyria][1]. This often happens to people who adhere to so-called \"alternative medicine\", which includes promoting silver suspension as a cure to all kinds of diseases.<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>\n\n### Lead\nLead is more dangerous than silver and is recognised as [important health problem by WHO][2].\n\n### Other examples\nI will defer listing of other [examples on wikipedia][3].\n\n## Toxification\nAs I said in the introduction, evolution didn't prepare liver and kidneys for many chemicals. Sometimes the attempt to react them starts the toxic reaction itself and it would be better if the chemical stayed in blood as-is and was excreted in urine. Such event is a type of [**toxification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxication), toxification can generally occur anywhere, not just liver.\n\n### Methanol\nMethanol is known as possible toxic component that can accidentally occur in alcoholic beverages. Methanol shares toxicity properties with ethanol, however on top of that, it is metabolized into formic acid in the liver. This is why, if there are no better alternatives, ethanol can be administered to prevent further methanol poisoning since it occupies the liver and therefore stops the toxification process. Bear in mind that this only works before the methanol was already turned into formic acid.<sup>\\[3\\]</sup>\n\n### Arsenic\nApart from accumulating, arsenic also is oxidated in body which produces much more toxic arsenic (III) oxide which is the famous deadly poison.\n\n### Refferences:\n\n - \\[1\\] [\"Chapter VIII: Germicides and Disinfectants\".

I include the medical terms, mostly because it may help finding further reading beyond what I suggest.\n\nAn approachable introduction to percutaneous absorption is [a review][1] written by Dr. Paul Brisson (it was in fact, used a source text in my schooling).\n\nLateral diffusion, how any drug spreads out from the application site as opposed to down through the skin, [varies on how the patch is actually made][2].  This is often measured as cm<sup>2</sup>/h, as the diffusion happens over time.  It should be noted that even with the constant application of the patch, you are going to get reduced diffusion based on concentrations gradients which roughly follow [Flick's laws of diffusion][3].  \n\nA standard salt gel formulation of DK (which is a good baseline, as any modifications will be at best 100x change in ether direction) has a lateral diffusion coefficient of [**<code>9.65x10<sup>-9</sup></code>**][4] cm<sup>2</sup>/h, and a rough saturation time of about [3 hours][2].  Even if we assume 10 hours of diffusion, and a 100X increase in the coefficient (<code>9.65x10<sup>-7</sup></code>), that still only gives us <code>9.65x10<sup>-7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup></code> lateral diffusion.  Let's round that off to an even 97 square nanometers.\n\nThat's smaller than the cross sectional area of many viral particles.  So you are quite right, a patch is most directly treating the area that it is directly on top of.  But this ignores another factor in patch dosing, which is that the drug is transferred to the plasma (blood), and then distributed systemically throughout the body.  Thus a significant portion of the dose that a prescribing physician is intending you to recieve might be through delivery from the blood.\n\n\nSo yes, you can sometimes cut a patch to deliver the drug better to a local area, but you should first check with your medical professional to be sure that the type of patch you are using can in fact be cut and still effective (some the nanogel suspensions can't be).\n\n  [1]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1947480/\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091375\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick's_laws_of_diffusion\n  [4]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/js960198e/abstract\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_epicondyle_of_the_humerus\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5267108", "5435": "The rapid ingestion of ice cold water can cause [death or syncope](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10208334) so it would seem sensible to drink those more slowly.

A large part of aging is the process of telomeres shortening with each cell division, making our DNA more vulnerable. As more DNA damage accumulates, more cells in the heart (and everywhere else in the body) become dysfunctional - that's essentially what aging is.\n\nSo while aging doesn't necessarily directly contribute to heart-related problems, the probability of organ failure, or dysfunctional symptoms in the organ gets higher as we age, due to more and more cells failing to perform their function.\n\nHere is a peer-reviewed paper on the subject (reading the abstract should be enough): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20532978\n\nHere is a study published in a UK medical journal linking DNA degradation due to aging with heart disease:\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10942-shrinking-telomeres-linked-to-heart-disease/\n\n**Corrected some information, thanks FrankyG**", "4985": "*Summary:* There are studies showing a difference in gastrointestinal problems and studies where no difference was observed.

However, they don't disappear, pointing towards there being both a systemic and local effect of naproxen for the stomach, independent of how it's delivered. \n\nA slightly larger (though still small) study [The efficacy and tolerability of enteric and non-enteric coated naproxen tablets: a double-blind study in patients with osteoarthritis][3] found no significant differences in either efficiency or tolerability, meaning that gastrointestinal problems appeared for both forms. \n\nAn [overview by Roche Pharmaceuticals][5] contains this passage:\n\n> [...] These studies indicated that EC\u00ad\nNAPROSYN and NAPROSYN showed no significant differences in efficacy \nor safety and had similar prevalence of minor GI complaints.

It was proposed in 1989 by Strachan and is about whether people who have been exposed to a lower amount of pathogens in their childhood are more likely to develop autoimmune or hypersensitivity (allergy) disorders later in life. Strachan actually didn't propose it in the context of hygiene, but in the context of families having less children and thus [children being exposed to their siblings' infections less often][2], though. He found that children with fewer siblings had a higher incidence of asthma and hayfever and came up with the hypothesis to explain his observation. The name has stuck, though.\n\nIs it true? Possibly.\n\nChromic inflammatory diseases are in fact [more prevalent in the so-called developed world][3]. As Ghana got richer and presumably 'cleaner', the [rates of allergies and asthma increased][4].\n\n*The role of vaccinations*\n\n> letting your kids get low-risk childhood sicknesses like mumps, rubella or chickenpox is \"training\" their immune systems\n\nBasically, no, even despite the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nFirst of all, whether these are not low-risk diseases is in fact debatable, but outside the scope of this question, I think. Mumps and measles can end in encephalitis. Since you can not guarantee that every child who isn't vaccinated will get the disease 'naturally', not vaccinating compromises [herd immunity][5] and can lead to the more vulnerable members of society (small children, immunocompromised patients, pregnant women) being exposed, which can lead to severe consequences.\n\nThe mechanism by which all of this works is a lot more complicated than that the immune system needs to be kept **busy**, though. It depends on [what the infections are, when they are, and what kind of immune response they raise][6].\n\nScientists have tried to determine *which* pathogens play a role in the hygiene hypothesis, and the result is now called the *old friends hypothesis*. From the summary of the [99<sup>th</sup> Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders][7]:\n\n> - The most relevant organisms are those that co-evolved with mammals, and already accompanied early hominids in the Paleolithic.\n> - More recently evolved \u2018childhood infections\u2019 are not likely to have evolved this role, and recent epidemiology supports this contention.\n\nPathogens usually indicated in research are [worm/parasite infections][6], and general exposure to bacteria from the environment. Household hygiene is likely to [only play a small part in the process][8], while an larger part is played by letting children be exposed to things outside of an urban environment.

The decreasing bone parameters reached new steady states after 3\u20138 years, depending on the parameter.

They cite numerous health benefits, among them benefit for bone mineral density :\n\n> Research suggests that weight bearing is superior to nutritional supplements in preventing BMD loss, and that the mechanical loading of the bones should be dynamic for full prevention of BMD loss. It also appears that with discontinuation of the weight bearing program, BMD levels will continue to decrease and/or return to pre-weight bearing values.\n\nThey cite a few studies for this benefit, among them:\n\n - [Static vs dynamic loads as an influence on bone remodelling][4]\n - [Low magnitude mechanical loading is osteogenic in children with disabling conditions][5]\n\nHowever, other research does not agree with this, saying that after the first year after the injury has passed, bone mineral density does not recover even from weight-bearing exercises. From [Non-pharmacological treatment and prevention of bone loss after spinal cord injury: a systematic review][6]:\n\n> For the chronic phase (Table 2), the picture seems more uniform, with very little evidence for any gain in BMD when the first year after injury has passed. \n\nThey also looked at studies regarding other intervention, for example electrical stimulation and found no significant benefits:\n\n> The level of evidence is important and in this study area, there is no conclusive indication of any effective intervention.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean your scenario would not work:\n\n 1. This is talking about losing bone mineral density compared to control groups. However, from standing assisting technology we know that the remaining bone density is enough to at least support short-term standing, bearing a significant part of the individual's body weight. A return to pre-paralysis levels might not be needed for short-term walking, for example. \n 2. The construction of such a device would lead to more studies into this. Right now, stopping the loss of bone density is not the primary motivating factor for the use of standing wheelchairs, for example - they are to increase quality of life and also to strengthen the individual's circulation, for example. \n\n  [1]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328204000146\n  [2]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2362.1990.tb01865.x/abstract;jsessionid=248754FDA1703F00620446C5C90A393A.f04t01\n  [3]: http://www.rstce.pitt.edu/RSTCE_Resources/Resna_position_on_wheelchair_standers.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6520138\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15040823\n  [6]: http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v47/n7/full/sc2008177a.html", "3949": "In general, no.\n\nA [ketogenic diet][1] is one where carbohydrates are eliminated and protein is restricted, to force the body to obtain its energy from the metabolism of fatty acids and ketone bodies, rather than the normal method of glucose metabolism.

An overdose can also cause headaches or dizziness, abnormal hearth rhythms, dehydration or sleep problems. According to PDR overdose occurs in doses corresponding to 300 mg of caffeine (approximately 5 cups of tea as a beverage).

If this happens in your digestive system it means that iron becomes insoluble, and cannot be absorbed. This decreases the effective uptake by your body, while regular loss via excretion and  desquamation remains the same, so over time you start having less and less iron at your body's disposal, which can lead to anemia. There were several studies that have proven this effect - many were epidemiological and observational. There was a clinical trial involving patients with haemochromatosis which also proved that drinking tea reduced iron absorption from the GIT.\n\n_____________________________________________________\nPossible solutions:\n\nDrinking decaf tea might solve the first problem, but won't solve the second. Moderation is the key. Also, drinking tea with or right after meals (especially those which are the greatest source of iron) should be avoided most of the times. Drinking tea is an indulgent ritual for many, so perhaps switching one or two cups a day for a herbal tea might help.\n\n___________________________________\n\nAn interesting aside: PDR cites studies which have proven that tea mouthwashes can reduce growth of some cavity-associated bacteria and reduce formation of plaque (the 2nd goes for oolong).

Diagnostic tests are considered \"useful\" if treatment decisions are affected by the results. Although it is extremely difficult to assess when overdiagnosis has occurred in an *individual*, it is relatively easy to assess when over diagnosis has occurred in a population. Rapidly rising rates of testing and disease diagnosis in the setting of stable death rates are suggestive of overdiagnosis.\n\nThere is some debate about how to best describe the problem, but narrowly defined, overdiagnosis can occur in at least three ways:\n\n- when screening tests become increasingly sensitive, identifying abnormalities that are minor, non-progressive, or likely to resolve on their own\n\n- when the definition of a disease changes such that conditions formerly to be thought \"compatible with normal\" are now classified as disease identifying as \"at risk\" people who will never suffer ill-effects from their condition\n\n- when tests performed unnecessarily show an abnormality for which the threshold of \"normal\" is unknown\n\nHaving a **diagnosis** makes well people think they're ill (overdiagnosis). If they are then treated for this overdiagnosis, they are **overtreated.**\n\nAn example of the first is in the newer, more sensitive tests for screening for thyroid cancer discussed in the NYT article. The overtreatment in this case is the unnecessary surgery (and complications thereof) because of the diagnosis.\n\nAn example involving changing definitions pertains to diabetes. When the official definition of diabetes changed from having a fasting blood sugar (FBS) of \"X or greater\" to an FBS of \"(X-y) or greater\" (a bit oversimplified, but still a good example), 1.6 million new diabetics were instantly *diagnosed*, some of whom are not likely to ever develop symptoms and complications and are not likely to benefit from treatment. \n\nAn example involving tests performed unnecessarily would be getting a head CT scan on a young, healthy person for a single seizure which could easily be explained by circumstance (e.g. being supported in an upright position during a feint), and finding an unrelated (and, say, benign) lesion, which someone then wants to biopsy.\n \n>...[We] are in the midst of an **epidemic of diagnosis**. Conventional wisdom tells us that finding problems early saves lives because we have the opportunity to fix the problems early. [That t]here is no risk in finding things early. The truth is that early diagnosis is a double-edged sword; while it has the potential to help some, it has a potential to harm us. Such *overdiagnosis* leads to *overtreatment* when these \u201cpseudo-diseases\u201d are conventionally managed and treated as if they were real abnormalities; because these findings have a benign prognosis, treatment can only do harm. \n\nProstate cancer is the poster child for overdiagnosis. Until we started widely screening for it with the prostate-specific antigen test, it was considered a disease with a uniformly bad prognosis. Only once screening (and treatment of detected tumors) was well underway did it come to light that the majority of prostate cancers detected by screening are clinically unimportant.  \n\nOverdiagnosis should not be confused with false-positive results, that is, a positive test in an individual who is subsequently recognized not to have cancer. By contrast, an overdiagnosed patient has a tumor that fulfills the pathological criteria for cancer. Studies now estimate that 1 in 2 prostate cancers, 1 in 3 breast cancers, and 1 in 5 lung cancers are most likely overdiagnosed.\n\nThe impact of false-positive test results is largely transitory, but the impact of overdiagnosis can be life-long and affects patients\u2019 sense of well-being and their ability to get health insurance; overtreatment impacts their physical health, and even their life expectancy.\n\nWhat can be done? Resistance to overdiagnosis needs to be multi-pronged. The medical community, through testing and experience, needs to raise the threshold to label a test as \u201cabnormal\u201d or raise the threshold to intervene.

However, studies (with women who've been diagnosed with breast cancer detected on screening) have shown that patients can make good decisions when presented with the appropriate facts.\n\nWhen your doctor recommends **screening** for a particular cancer because of age or other demographic factors (e.g. you're a smoker), **ask**. Ask how you're likely to benefit from the test if it comes back positive, ask if there is any controversy about the screening test, ask if there are hand-outs explaining the risks and benefits of the screening test. \n\n<sub>N.B. **This does not pertain to all tests ordered by physicians.** Not all screening tests are bad, and tests need to be done when you have symptoms.<sub>  \n\n<sub>Cancer overdiagnosis may have of one of two explanations: 1) The cancer never progresses (or, in fact, regresses) or 2) the cancer progresses slowly enough that the patient dies of other causes before the cancer becomes symptomatic. Note that this second explanation incorporates the interaction of three variables: the cancer size at detection, its growth rate, and the patient\u2019s competing risks for mortality. Thus, even a rapidly growing cancer may still represent overdiagnosis if detected when it is very small or in a patient with limited life expectancy.</sub>  \n\n<sub>[The effect of information about\u00a0overdetection of breast cancer on women\u2019s decision-making about\u00a0mammography screening:study protocol for a randomised controlled trial](http://www.academia.edu/7155800/The_effect_of_information_about_overdetection_of_breast_cancer_on_womens_decision-making_about_mammography_screening_study_protocol_for_a_randomised_controlled_trial)</sub>  \n<sub>[Mammography for Women Aged 40 and Older: A Decision Aid for Breast Cancer Screening in Canada](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cd-mc/pdf/Information_on_Mammography-eng.pdf)</sub>  \n<sub>[Overdiagnosis in Cancer](http://www.thyroidcancercanada.org/userfiles/files/Welch_Overdiagnosis%20in%20Cancer.pdf)</sub>  \n<sub>[Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qe7XQxzAftEC&oi=fnd&pg=PT5&dq=Welch+G,+Schwartz+L,+Woloshin+S+%282011%29+Overdiagnosed:&ots=GONGUjZ8HY&sig=CQy031VkHIqGxgM8Sg0vnQOCB_A#v=onepage&q&f=false)</sub>  \n<sub>[Overdiagnosis](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/overdiagnosis/)</sub>  \n<sub>[Using Evidence to Combat Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001655#pmed.1001655-Welch1)</sub>  \n<sub>[The prostate specific antigen era in the United States is over for prostate cancer: what happened in the last 20 years?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15371827)</sub>  \n  \n ", "1505": "No. Nexium is the trade name of a generic drug called [esomeprazole][eso], a [proton pump inhibitor][ppi] used to treat [gastro-esophageal acid reflux][ar]. \u201cNitrates for chest pain\u201d refers to the class of cardiac drugs that share a similar biochemical structure structure and pharmacologic mechanism, which involves conversion to nitric oxide.

First urine is nothing more than : \n\n>Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water, with the remaining constituents, in order of decreasing concentration, urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds (see this [nasa study][1])\n\nWe know that urine is [not 100% sterile][2], but usually won't harm a healthy people if you drink it (and the urine is from a healthy person too that didn't drink any drug or poisons) but the only situation i can see it would be good to drink your own urine is if you are dehydrating to death and even that is not really recommended ( see this wonderful question on [skeptics.se][3] ) \n\nBut you could think if we have potassium and other minerals in urine why not drink it? Because you can get much more by eating food and hormones are produced by your own body you don't need to drink pee to replace that, and they become urine for a good reason, see the conclusion of [this study][4] :\n\n>It is strongly suggested that alternative therapies should be non-hazardous, and therefore, inappropriate administration of remedies, such as urine therapy in pediatric health conditions should be discouraged, considering the fact that no documented scientific / clinical evidence of the beneficial effect of urine therapy in clinical had been reported, while multiple antibiotic resistant bacterial species had also been recovered from such urine.\n\nEdit: About your medicines listed.\n\n- [Metrodin][5] = Wrong. Metrodin is is a man-made hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland. **May** appear on urine, however in **very low** concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\n\n- [Pergonal][6] = Wrong. Menotropins are a mixture of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) that are produced in the body by the pituitary gland. **May** appear on urine, however in **very low** concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\n\n- [Panafil][7] = Wrong.It is a proteolytic enzyme derived from the fruit of carica papaya. The only **possible** (not 100%) way its going to end up in your urine is if you are eating the fruit.\n\n- [2-CdA][8] = 2-CdA is the trade name for cladribine. Leustatin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine are other names for cladribine. It **was** extracted from urine and according to Wikipedia it was first synthesized at Brigham Young University (meaning they don't extract it from urine anymore), they do appear in urine but in **too low** concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\n\n- [Urokinase][9] and [Wikipedia page][10] = Urokinase is a man-made product developed using a protein that occurs naturally in the kidneys. Urokinase is made from human kidney cells and albumin (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Urokinase was originally **isolated** from human urine, but is present in several physiological locations, such as blood stream and the extracellular matrix. Again, they do appear in urine but in **too low** concentrations to justify drinking your own pee.\n\nWhy drinking your own pee to get this substances is completely non-sense?\n\n> A single [Banana][11] have 450mg of potassium or 13% of our recommended intake. 2L of urine have 1500mg potassium or ~31% of recommended daily intake. But at this scale you would get 18,6g of urea, 3,74g of chloride and 2,34g of sodium too.\n\nNow [American Heart Association in 2010 chose to recommend that Americans eat less than 1,500 mg/day sodium as part of the definition of ideal cardiovascular health.][12]. So you going 840mg above your ideal sodium consumption only with urine, **long term drinking urine and a diet high in sodium will really hurt your health.** (I don't think i have to cite the consequences of too much sodium right? Just google for it)\n\nNow see the dangers of excess of [Chloride][13] note that **The normal adult value for chloride is 97-107 mEq/L.** and you will be consuming 3,74g to get only ~31% of your potassium intake. I didn't find a good converter online so i will let this to someone who can do this math. But just 1g/l is a lot more than 107meq/l. You only going to make your poor kidney to work much harder to handle all this chloride.\n\nNow about urea, this [study][14] says:\n\n>There is limited information to suggest that the liver, kidney, and pituitary could be targets of urea toxicity. Under the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2005a), there is \u201cinadequate information to assess the carcinogenic potential\u201d of urea. Epidemiologic studies of humans chronically exposed to urea alone or urea-containing mixtures are limited.\n\nBut drinking 18,6g of urea daily surely can't be good to you. There is no scientific evidence for health benefits of drinking this. Lack of studies is not equal to no toxicity! \n\nFor hormones i think you can see why is totally no-sense, the amount of urine you would have to drink to get any considerable amount would be insane and toxic.\n\n\n  [1]: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710023044_1971023044.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/urine-not-sterile-and-neither-rest-you\n  [3]: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1540/is-it-a-good-idea-to-drink-your-own-urine-in-a-survival-situation\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032614/\n  [5]: http://www.drugs.com/cons/metrodin.html\n  [6]: http://www.drugs.com/cons/pergonal.html\n  [7]: http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/panafil/description_pharmacology/\n  [8]: http://www.chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/cladribine.aspx\n  [9]: http://www.drugs.com/mtm/urokinase.html\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Urokinase\n  [11]: http://www.livescience.com/45005-banana-nutrition-facts.html\n  [12]: http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQs-About-Sodium_UCM_306840_Article.jsp\n  [13]: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/side-effects/hyperchloremia-high-chloride.aspx\n  [14]: http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/1022tr.pdf", "1067": "So it's important to separate cravings/[specific hungers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_hunger) from [taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste).  \n\nOne's body should, to some degree be able to adjust it's specific hungers to meet it's dietary needs.  This one area where our larger brains come with a catch 22.  While being smarter and aware allows us to feed ourselves better, we also can ignore or improperly process the bodies attempt to control our appetites.\n\nMoving on to taste buds ([here is a better review than wiki][1]).  The average taste bud lasts 8-12 days ([ibid][2]), so if you're noticing an effect before then, it's probably not related.  Also, there development and distribution is associated with genetic and [epigenetic][3] factors, not environment and diet.\n\nInstead I think that you are noticing that your taste receptors, like most sensory systems, become less responsive after saturation and repeated stimulation.\n\nIf we look at part F of the [following figure][4]:\n\n![Choi et al figure 5][5]\n \nYou will notice how the response of the taste bud to a salty solution decreased significantly after each application (the time between each stimulus was 10 min).

What we do know is:\n\n - A large egg contains about 185 mg of cholesterol.

The two studies cited indicate that consumption of eggs does not raise cholesterol levels significantly for about 3/4ths of the population.\n\n**Fat and Calories**\n\nEach egg yolk contains 6 g of fat and 54 kcal. Even though they're full of nutrients, they still do contain calories, so factor that into your daily intake. Someone who does an average amount of physical activity would probably require an average amount of eggs. Definitely not something on the level of dozens, but even so, giving any numbers would be hard since there are so many factors in play.\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals**\n\nEggs are naturally rich in vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iodine. They also contain vitamin A and a number of other B vitamins including folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline, and essential minerals and trace elements, including phosphorus.

These have failed to convincingly reject the null hypothesis, meaning that they have not demonstrated a clear biological response to acupuncture for any indication. The better controlled studies consistently show that needle location does not matter (sham acupuncture), and that needle insertion does not matter (placebo acupuncture). You can literally have a non-acupuncturist randomly poke someone with toothpicks and get the same response as the full acupuncture treatment.\n\nAnd described the current paper:\n\n>  A recent study looked at performing acupuncture on a phantom limb.\n> They used a now well-established technique of tricking the brain into\n> incorporating a dummy body part as if it were real. They placed\n> subjects in front of a table so that one of their arms was below the\n> table, with a rubber arm above the table placed in such a way that\n> visually the rubber arm looked like their own arm. They then stroke\n> the rubber arm and the subjects real arm simultaneously. The brain\n> sees and feels the rubber arm being stroked, and this sensory feedback\n> is often enough for the brain to create the sensation of ownership\n> over the rubber arm.\n> \n> The researchers then placed acupuncture needles into the rubber arm\n> that subjects had incorporated as their own. Obviously there is no\n> possibility of any physiological response from the needle penetrating\n> the rubber arm. I further think it is reasonable to conclude that\n> placing a needle into a rubber arm cannot activate acupuncture points\n> (if they existed) or alter Qi (if it existed). This experiment nicely\n> eliminates local physiological responses and any Qi responses to the\n> needles.\n> \n> The researchers performed functional MRI scanning (fMRI) on subjects\n> while needles were placed in their phantom rubber limbs. Keep in mind\n> that fMRI research involves collecting lots of data and aggregating\n> it. So the researchers are not looking at brain reactions in real\n> time, just the aggregate brain activity of many subjects over many\n> trials. They then look for statistical associations in the activity.\n> \n> What they found was the same brain activation that previous studies\n> have found with acupuncture of real limbs.\n> \n> \n>> When the rubber hand was fully incorporated with the real body,\n> acupuncture stimulation to the rubber hand resulted in the experience\n> of the DeQi sensation as well as brain activations in the dorsolateral\n> prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, secondary somatosensory cortex\n> (SII), and medial temporal (MT) visual area. The insular activation\n> was associated with the DeQi sensation from the rubber hand.\n> \n> If these results hold up, this implies that the brain is simply\n> responding to the expectation and visualization of the needle\n> penetration. Actual needle penetration is unnecessary. The most\n> parsimonious interpretation of this data is that acupuncture is all in\n> the mind. There is no need to hypothesize the existence of Qi,\n> acupuncture points, or a specific physiological mechanism for\n> acupuncture.\n> \n> There are plenty of studies that show that the perception of pain is\n> easily manipulated by simple things such as distraction.

One brand name for this product is Transderm-Scop.\n\nI will write below why it is placed behind the ear, but in terms of the Facebook post, it's probably not accurate. In fact, Snopes.com did a 'Fact-Check' [article][1] on a similar subject.\n\nScopolamine is an antimuscarinic medication with strong anticholinergic effects. Anticholinergics are used for a variety of purposes, from motion sickness to pupil dilation (if you ever had your doctor dilate your pupils, it most likely was from an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or tropicamide).\n\nMany drugs have 'anticholinergic' side effects as well. These side effects include:\n\n - Sedation\n - Dry mouth\n - Urinary retention\n - Dry eyes (blurred vision)\n\n\nBenadryl, perhaps the most commonly used over the counter antihistamine, has relatively strong anticholinergic effects, which is why it makes you tired. [Dramamine][2] also has strong anticholinergic effects, which is why it is marketed specifically for motion sickness.\n\nThe anticholinergic effects of drugs are dose dependent, meaning high doses yield greater effects. Very high doses can cause:\n\n - Hyperthermia\n - Confusion\n - Cardiac abnormalities\n - Loss of muscle control\n - Coma\n\nOral anticholinergic drugs are notorious for their sometimes severe side effects and overdose, either accidental or deliberate, can be extremely serious.\n\nGoing back to scopolamine...the anticholinergic effects of the drug are quite effective for preventing motion sickness. The patches go behind the ear not because it is close in proximity to the vestibular system of the inner ear (important for our sense of balance), but because it is one of the more permeable, and consistent trans-dermal absorption areas on our body.\n\nVery small amounts of scopolamine are in the Transderm-Scop patch. It is designed to deliver a **total** of 1mg **over** a 72 hours period at a constant rate. With such a small dose, it is important to not have significant deviations in drug absorption.\n\nOverall, the patch was designed to a provide predictable delivery of scopolamine, resulting in in precise plasma concentrations.\n\nIn terms of skin permeability, the postauricular area (behind the ear) is the most [permeable][3] of any site on the body. This allows very small doses to be used, and reduces the risk of adverse reactions.\n\nEven though the area behind the ear generally provides more predictable drug delivery, there is still significant variation among individuals. \n\nDue to this, the patches have a rate-limiting membrane. This membrane produces a permeation rate that is slower than the skin can absorb (this is based on [studies][4] of different human skin types). So the system (and not individual variability of the skin), controls systemic scopolamine delivery.\n\nTo summarize, the patches are put behind the ear because:\n\n - Small doses of scopolamine can be used\n - The skin behind the ear is the most permeable for trans-dermal absorption and provides the most consistent blood levels of the drug.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/burundangascopolamine-warning/\n  [2]: https://www.pharmacistanswers.com/questions/diphenhydramine-and-dimenhydrinate-what-is-the-difference\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/702282\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16719539", "17942": "Long-term ketogenic diet can have various side effects.\n\n[Safety and tolerability of the ketogenic diet used for the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy: a systematic review of published prospective studies (PubMed, 2017):][1]\n\n> The most common adverse effects included **gastrointestinal disturbances**\n> (40.6%), **hyperlipidemia** (12.8%), **hyperuricemia** (4.4%), **lethargy**\n> (4.1%), **infectious diseases** (3.8%) and **hypoproteinemia** (3.8%).\n\n[Dietary Therapies For Epilepsy (BioMed Journal, 2013)][2]:\n\n> Side effects include **constipation, dyslipidemia, growth slowing,\n> acidosis,** and **kidney stones.**\n\n[Ketogenic diets and physical performance (PubMed, 2004)][3]:\n\n> **Impaired physical performance** is a common but not obligate result of a\n> low carbohydrate diet.\n\n[Ketogenic diet in endocrine disorders: Current perspectives (PubMed, 2017)][4]:\n\n> The moderate adverse effects comprised of...**mineral\n> deficiencies**...\n\n[Ketovale][5] mentions many side effects from a mixture of anecdotal and study reports: the side effects mentioned above plus **keto flu (headache, weakness, brain fog, increased hunger and fatigue), acetone-like breath, muscle cramps, insomnia, reduced bone mineral density, keto rash**...\n\nAccording to [2 cohort studies following 3,966 adults for 20-26 years: (PubMed, 2010)][6]\n\n> A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with\n> higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a\n> vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet was associated with lower\n> all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28702868\n  [2]: http://biomedj.cgu.edu.tw/pdfs/2013/36/1/images/BiomedJ_2013_36_1_2_107152.pdf\n  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507148/\n  [4]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664869/\n  [5]: https://www.ketovale.com/side-effects-of-keto-diet/\n  [6]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989112/", "17723": "It will most likely depend on the location of the injury if there's tension (joint areas) and not the depth, size or type of injury.\n\n\"There is evidence suggesting that increased mechanical tension can initiate hypertrophic scars formation.Based on this hypothesis, it makes sense to minimize mechanical forces after surgery.

I'll address the question of maintaining 'optimal health to old age' according to the biopsychosocial model of health.\n<p>\n1. Biology - One of the best habits to develop from an early age is to have a <b>healthy diet and exercise regularly</b>. A healthy diet includes eating more vegetables, cutting back on the sugary beverages and fried food (trans fat). For exercise, the American Heart Association suggests \"at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise [~20 min./day] or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise (or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity).\" This habit is important for maintaining a healthy BMI and reducing the risk for many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, etc. \n\n<p> \n2. Psychology - A critical skill to develop is <b>mindfulness</b> - being able to anchor one's attention to the present experience. This skill includes learning to handle stress, process one's emotional state, overcoming self-destructive thoughts, understanding who you are, etc. All are important to maintaining good mental health. Mindfulness can be developed in many ways: writing, meditating, paying more attention to the world around you.  \n\n<p> \n3. Sociology - The main habit to cultivate here is to <b>build healthy relationships</b> - with family, friends, workers, etc. It's important to have a support network during times of trouble. Not to mention the amount of stress (and resulting illnesses) that can be avoided by giving more care to the social part of life. Personally, I've found the best ways to learn about building healthy relationships is through: listening, reading, empathy.   \n\n\nMy answer is of course not exhaustive - I merely gave a good faith effort at pinning some of the more general habits that have long term health effects. For example, another simple habit under the biology category is to avoid tobacco use.\n\nFinally, I do want to point out that a habit that contains all of these best lifestyle habits is: <b>take an interest in your health</b> (a.k.a. learning!). \nDon't stop at just reading this answer. Keep an eye out for the news on the latest health research, public health promotions, articles on the net (do check the validity),  etc. \n__________________________________________________________________________\nReferences:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471136/\">Healthy Diet</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp#.WuanxogvxPY\">Exercise Recommendation by American Heart Association</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11795/\"> Prevention of Chronic Disease by Means of Diet and Lifestyle Changes</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44249/#A1181\">Mental Health: Culture, Race, Ethnicity</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679190/\">Importance of Mindfulness</a>\n", "15967": "A **regular caffeine consumer** will likely develop a partial or complete **tolerance** to many caffeine effects and side effects, including increased heart rate.

The target population is assumed to be the general population. The panel considers that an increase in faecal bulk might be a beneficial physiological effect. In weighing the evidence, the panel took into account that the majority of the human intervention studies showed a consistent effect of wheat bran fibre on faecal bulk and that no threshold dose for the effect can be established. A linear dose dependent relationship was demonstrated in several studies.\nThe claimed effects are \u2018gut health\u2019 and \u2018intestinal transit time, intestinal health\u2019. The target population is assumed to be the general population. In the context of the clarifications provided by Member States, the panel assumes that the claimed effect refers to a reduction in intestinal transit time. The panel considers that a reduction in intestinal transit time within the normal range might be a beneficial physiological effect. In weighing the evidence, the panel took into account that the studies provided consistently indicated that wheat bran fibre consumed at an amount of at least 10 g/day decreased intestinal transit time.\n\nThe claim for nutrients provided by wheat bran would likely have been rejected on account of the anti-nutrient phytic acid which is tightly bound to minerals\n\n> Most of the minerals in wheat kernels are present as complexes with phytic acid. Mature wheat grain has high phytase activity, hydrolysing phytates and making the minerals nutritionally available (Brinch-Pedersen et al. 2002). However, the presence of phytate has been considered as an anti-nutrient in humans because of its effect on the bioavailability of iron, magnesium, zinc and calcium. While the mechanism is not entirely understood, it is suggested that phytic acid binds strongly with these mineral cations to form phytate\u2013mineral complexes, changing their solubility, functionality absorption and digestibility (Rickard and Thompson 1997). Consequently, the complex cannot be absorbed or easily hydrolysed by the human body and so there is an adverse effect on bioavailability of minerals (Harland and Harland 1980).\n\nso the status of nutrient access from wheat bran remains unclear.\n\nThose issues don't apply so much to shredded wheat which is the whole grain being cooked and shredded as the amount of phytic acid is much less.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507301/", "15074": "Other answers have explained why being vaccinated is generally a good idea, and I fully support the ones that do.

The article is mostly worried about Thimerosal, which is used as a preservative. The US National Toxicology Department has tested this ingredient in response to fears, and you can see the results [here][2]. It tells us the following:\n\n> In this study, the LD50 of thimerosal in rats was 98 mg/kg\n\nThe LD50 being 98mg/kg means that, to have a 50% chance of killing a rat that weighs one kilogram, you'll need to inject 98mg of Thimerosal. Looking at [this][3], 400g for a rat's weight seems like a reasonable estimate, so it'll take about 40mg of Thimerosal to have a 50% chance of killing a pet rat. Heading back to your article:\n\n> As you can see from this snapshot, the package insert readily admits that each vaccine dose \u201ccontains 50 mcg thimerosal (<25 mcg mercury).\u201d\n\nYep, it absolutely does. Converting the units, 50mcg=0.05mg. If we want to kill that rat from Thimerosal poisoning, we'd need to inject it with 800 of these flu shots. I'm going to re-state this in big text just in case you're only skimming:\n\n**To stand a decent chance of killing a pet rat from mercury poisoning, you'd need to inject it with 800 of the flu vaccines discussed in that article, all at the same time**\n\nYou're probably a lot bigger than your average lab rat, so we're talking tens of thousands of flu shots before the mercury inside it starts getting dangerous.\n\nThe article also discusses formaldehyde, and if you're interested you can do your own research into the toxicity of that and see how many flu shots you'd need to be in danger of death from formaldahyde poisoning.\n\nIt's a real shame that the articles trying to tell you vaccines are dangerous are so exciting to read, whilst articles describing actual scientific research are so dry and boring. You can see why ideas like this gain so much traction - it's terribly exciting to read!

Death certificate data and weekly influenza virus surveillance information was used to estimate how many flu-related deaths occurred among people whose underlying cause of death on their death certificate included respiratory or circulatory causes.\n\nSo deaths from influenza are often from a secondary bacterial pneumonia or excessive immune response (cytokine storm) to the flu infection.  Some young people can die [within hours](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/here-s-how-flu-virus-kills-some-people-so-quickly-n839936) of the flu infection from the latter reason.  \n\nAnd if we just look at [hospitalization rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5359836/table/Tab3/) we can see that for the age range 18-49, the rate of 41/100,000 is under half that of the average but twice higher than age range 5-17 years. \n\nAnd 50 million deaths from the 1918 pandemic makes your statement that \"flu is an irritant\" completely erroneous.\n\nInterestingly a [new paradigm](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanpub/PIIS2468-2667(17)30004-X.pdf) for managing seasonal flu has been suggested.  The issue is that the people who most need the vaccination (elderly, sick, very young) are those that benefit the least from vaccination due to an impaired immune response to the vaccine, and it may be more effective to vaccinate the older young who respond well to vaccination:\n\n> Furthermore, influenza\nepidemiology is unfortunately characterised by\ndissociation between populations most likely to\nhave severe disease (infants and elderly people), and\npopulations most likely to benefit from vaccination\n(older children and adolescents\u2014ie, those aged\n2\u201316 years).3\n Older children and adolescents seem to\nbe important for the early propagation of influenza\nin populations, and the efficacy of influenza vaccines\nis greater in these populations than in elderly people,\nbut they are generally not prioritised for immunisation\nbecause of their lower risk of morbidity and mortality\nfrom this infection.3\n This paradoxical state of affairs\nhas led some researchers to suggest that the best way\nto minimise the burden of seasonal influenza would\nbe to focus immunisation programmes on children,\nadolescents, and young adults, with benefit accrued by\nelderly people and infants as a result of herd immunity.3\n\nAnd ...\n\n> analysis highlights\nthe importance of herd effects for decision makers:\na rapidly implemented LAIV programme focused on\nchildren aged 2\u201316 years is actually more effective\nat preventing disease in elderly people than a more\nslowly implemented programme that includes both\nLAIV and direct immunisation of elderly people\nthemselves. This finding is because a rapid, early focus\non young individuals, in whom the vaccine is more\neffective, stops the influenza epidemic in its tracks. \n\n", "15051": "\n\nAn earlier warning regarding medications in children with chicken pox came to the following conclusion:\n> [**The safety of ibuprofen suspension in children.

There was no association with the use of ibuprofen or paracetamol alone, but the use of both agents was significantly associated with streptococcal infection.

NICE (2016) recommends that NSAIDs should not be used in children with chickenpox due to its link to potentially life- and limb-threatening necrotising bacterial super-infection associated with group A streptococcus. A case-control study (n=140,111), undertaken in primary care in the UK, provides evidence to support this guidance (Mikaeloff et al 2008).<br>\n> **In summary, NSAIDs and aspirin should be avoided in patients with chickenpox, and pain and pyrexia should be controlled with reasonable alternatives, such as paracetamol (Durand et al 2015).**\n\nThere are still very vocal practitioners, concluding from their professional experience and the evidence from literature, that especially in severe cases of fever iboprofen is still not strictly *contra-indicated*: [Ibuprofen bei Varizellen nicht kontraindiziert][3]. Although they too place paracetamol at first place for the medication of choice, they also emphasise a generally very cautious approach to previously too light heartedly prescribed medications in general.\n\n\nMy own conclusion from this would be to try to avoid ibuprofen, aspirin *and* paracetamol.

In fact, there is a high correlation between IBS and stress. \n\nGiven the high levels of anxiety and stress commonly seen in patients with [Irritable Bowel Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2095723/), evidence suggests that the syndrome may be linked to a disruption of the stress system. The stress response in the body involves the sympathetic nervous system which has been shown to operate abnormally in IBS patients.\n\n\nIn an article by [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection), scientists are inferring that \u2018*the little brain*\u2019, or enteric nervous system (ENS) is the link between what's going on in the gut and it's effect on the brain, or the relationship between digestion and mood.\n\n> Anxiety and depression have been thought to contribute to gastro conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nJay Pastricha, MD, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology states that the main role of the ENS is:\n\n> \"...controlling digestion, from swallowing to the release of enzymes that break down food, to the control of blood flow that helps with nutrient absorption to elimination.\"\n\nAs described in [Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach](https://books.google.com/books?id=32dHPgAACAAJ&dq=0321541308), when your sympathetic nervous system is activated by a stressful event, for example, it initiates a \u201cfight or flight\u201d response -- a mechanism that primes the body for action, particularly in situations that threaten survival. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels, including those in the digestive tract. Because the blood vessels in the gastrointestinal organs constrict, the digestive tract will inhibit peristalsis (digestion) and result in a variety of GI symptoms.\n\nThe GI tract is generally sensitive to emotion in most people (even those who do not have IBS) as anger, anxiety, sadness, and elation (among others) can all trigger symptoms in the gut. For example, you've likely heard or even spoken the words \"going with your gut\" when making a decision or feeling like you have \"butterflies in your stomach\" when feeling nervous. In people who suffer from IBS however, the ENS may trigger big emotional shifts which can lead to functional bowel problems such as **constipation**, **diarrhea**, bloating, pain, and stomach upset. \n\nPeople with IBS can experience either constipation, diarrhea, or both depending on the individual and how their emotionally triggered symptoms present. According to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20360064): \n\n> For the purpose of treatment, IBS can be divided into three types based on your symptoms: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), or mixed.\n\nResearch also suggests that digestive system activity may affect cognition (thinking skills and memory). As explained by a [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection) article:\n\n> The brain has a direct effect on the stomach. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person\u2019s stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause *or* the product of anxiety, stress, or depression.\n\nIn an effort to provide further evidence in response to \"How does your mental state actually affect the functioning of the bowel?\":\n\nPsychological factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as presenting symptoms. As it relates to IBS, stress can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract or can increase inflammation. Additionally, people with IBS may perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains do not properly regulate pain signals from the GI tract. When faced with a stress-causing event, the existing pain can feel worse. As stated in the article, ['The Brain-Gut Connection'](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection): \n\n> Irritation in the gastrointestinal system may send signals to the CNS that trigger mood changes, which is why a higher than normal percentage of people with IBS and other bowel disorders develop depression and anxiety.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, foods very high in vitamin K include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, soy oil, green tea, tofu, spinach and other dark leafy greens. For those who take warfarin, it is recommended to avoid large fluctuations in vitamin K intake. Large amounts of vitamin K can cause the drug to become less effective, and consuming vitamin K in smaller amounts than is customary for a particular person may increase the effectiveness of the drug and result in bleeding. Maintaining a consistent intake of vitamin K in the diet will allow the physician to make the most therapeutic changes to the warfarin dose.\n\nWhilst it is **possible** that citrus foods can be eaten, **it is advisable to consult your doctor before doing so to ensure that the correct information is given for your personal situation**\n\n<h2>Whatever you do, do not go against advice given by your doctor as it can risk your life when on blood thinning medications such as Warfarin or any other (complimentary or alternative) blood thinning products</h2>\n\n  [1]: http://www.empr.com/medical-news/fruits-most-likely-to-cause-warfarin-interactions/article/366309/\n  [2]: https://doi.org/10.1177/0897190014544823\n  [3]: https://doi.org/10.4103/0975-1483.66808\n  [4]: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombophlebitis/expert-answers/warfarin/faq-20058443\n  [5]: http://www.livestrong.com/article/519474-warfarin-oranges", "12706": "**Short answer:** maybe a few, but not instantly.\n\nNicotine poisoning exists but rarely is it fatal.

It acts as a barrier.  You also have to account for showering.  If you shower right after sun exposure, you will reduce some of your D3 because it is synthesized at skin level & then absorbed.  It is possible for a human to make 50,000iu in a day.  There are always factors in play, such as complexion, tanning, and global location that will impact exactly how much a given person makes.  There have been studies where this is attempted to be measured, but even in situations where they exposed 2 people to the same thing, they had one person with 20ng higher blood values than the other, and that is significantly higher. \n\nPersonally I live in a Northern climate so I just supplement year round.  If you take D3 (not D2) it is all coming from natural sources & will operate within your body just as effectively as sunshine.  I also supplement my children from birth.  I can't swear it works,  but I can say we have never needed a sick visit to a doctor other than one time for one child for excessive vomiting, which I have never thought D3 could prevent.  We do not experience typical childhood illness at all & we are not particularly careful other than to aim for a very high nG value on bloodwork because I happen to personally believe it matters for immune system functioning.  So what we take is well in excess of what is generally recommended, but it's all completely approved through our Drs & all have been extremely happy that we are taking the levels we are taking.  I can also say I am the only parent I know of multiple children who completely skipped early infant illnesses.  I worked too, so they weren't home all day with me, but none of my children ran so much as a fever or runny nose before age 2.  They didn't inherit that.  Their parents both were the typically sick children that you anticipate all kids will be, lots of coughs, colds, general stuff. \n\nHere is some info on the various nG levels that were found for various people under the same situations/exposures. https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/how-do-we-know-how-much-vitamin-d-you-make/\n\nHere is a lot of information on how D3 impacts immune functions. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678245/\n\nSorry I cannot be more accurate to determine precisely what a given person would make in a given situation.  I do not think bodies work like that though.  It seems on the studies I have come across, similarly sized people of the same complexion & same exposure still manage to synthesize it differently enough to be notable.  It's relatively easy & inexpensive to get your blood tested for D3, at least where I live, so if you are truly curious about your own production, you can certain request testing.  I think all people should be checked at least yearly.  It's such an important nutrient.  It behaves much more like a hormone than a vitamin & there is a receptor for D3 on nearly every tissue & cell type in your body.  It impacts all things, from immune health to brain development & function, to heart health.  So I think on the whole, we are missing the mark medically when we so rarely test it & recommend such low supplementation while living in an era where people see less sunshine that likely ever before.

Your body tries to fit the situation by decreasing your muscle mass and thus to decrease the needed energy to maintain your body. However, in order to prevent possible muscle atrophy, there have been several methods.\n\n>Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in muscles containing high proportions of type II or fast-twitch fibers. <sup>[1][1]</sup>\n\nIn case you shouldn't know what different muscle fibers are and how they are distributed in your body, I've got you.\n\n>Humans have basically three different types of muscle fibers. Slow- twitch (ST or Type I) fibers are identified by a slow contraction time and a high resistance to fatigue. [...] Most activities of daily living use ST fibers. Fast-twitch (FT or Type II) fibers are identified by a quick con- traction time and a low resistance to fatigue. [...] Fast-twitch fibers are further divided into fast-twitch A (FT -A or Type IIA) and fast- twitch B (FT -B or Type lIB) fibers. FT -A fibers have a moderate resistance to fatigue and represent a transition between the two extremes of the ST and FT -B fibers. [...] Fast-twitch B fibers, on the other hand, are very sensitive to fatigue and are used for short anaerobic, high force production activities, such as sprinting, hurdling, jumping, and putting the shot. [...] <sup>[2][2]</sup>\n<hr>\n>The distribution of different fiber types varied within the muscles, as a function of depth, with a predominance of type 2b fibers at the surface and type 1 fibers in deeper regions of the muscle. <sup>[3][3]</sup>\n\nSo it's possible to prevent muscle atrophy in type II muscle fibers by simply exercising.\n\nIf you suffer from a serious illness or are physically-challenged, you can maintain your muscle mass by using functional electrical stimulation. The idea is to stimulate your cells so that they keep their current state or to provoke hypertrophy.\n\n>[...] Previous research shows that neuromuscular or `functional' electrical stimulation (FES), particularly FES-cycle ergometry (FES-CE) can cause muscle hypertrophy in individuals with chronic SCI (&gt;1 year post-injury). However, the modest degree of hypertrophy in these already atrophied muscles has lessened earlier hopes that FES therapy would reduce secondary impairments of SCI. [...] <sup>[4][4]</sup>\n\nAfter a short search, I was able to find some experimental studies with rats to investigate muscle atrophy more deeply. It should be obvious that you shouldn't take in Clenbuterol without a consultation with your doctor and of course not solely on the results of the study.\n\n>Clenbuterol attenuated the decrease in muscle mass and single fiber cross-sectional area in both age groups. By preventing the loss of muscle mass, clenbuterol administered early in rehabilitation may benefit severely debilitated patients imposed by inactivity. [...] <sup>[5][5]</sup>\n\nThe University of Hull did some research and found out that basic stretching for 30 minutes each day can prevent muscle atrophy in immobilized muscles.\n\n>[...] It was found that periods of stretch as short as 1/2 h daily were sufficient not only to prevent loss of sarcomeres but actually to cause an increase in the number of sarcomeres in series. [...] Such short periods of stretch were also found to prevent much of the muscle atrophy normally associated with immobilisation in the shortened position. <sup>[6][6]</sup>\n\nI'll end up with a study regarding the loss muscle mass in the elderly and how to promote muscle hypertrophy in them.\n\n>[...] Strength training appears to elicit effective countermeasures in elderly individuals even at a very old age (>80 years) by evoking muscle hypertrophy along with substantial changes in neuromuscular function, respectively. [...] <sup>[7][7]</sup>\n\nSo long story short: The best way is to simply exercise to keep your muscles and yourself pumped, as @TheEnvironmentalist already said. There are indeed ways to do this by not exercising but the chemical idea as well as the functional electrical stimulation are still in progress. Nonetheless, you should read the corresponding Wikipedia article <sup>[8][8]</sup> to FES to inform yourself in this regard.\n\n<hr>\n\n1.

Specific pathogens tend to cause additional symptoms on top of that, some of which seem to be directly related to viral damage.\n\n\n----------\nFirst, I want to point out to a very nice [website/data set][1] from the **Common Cold Project** (CCP).  The [publications][2] from the comprising trails is a good repository for information on the common cold. \n\n*It should be noted that there were a few experimental design problems that they were unable to avoid (for a combination of cost and lack of knowledge).  It turned out the the [RSV][3] challenge strain used in the British study was not a very [pathogenic][4] strain.  Further, as it has [delayed onset][5] of symptoms meant that it wasn't well studied with in the time frame of the trial.  That said, it provides a good deal of details on [HRV][6], and the \"common cold\" more generally.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nWhat are the common symptoms of the common cold?\n------------------------------------------------\nThis might seem like a more obvious question, but it's what must be answered first before the broader question of what is being caused by the virus is addressed.\n\nOne of the better lists of symptoms comes from the first [British study][7] mentioned in the CCP:\n\n 1. Cough\n 2. Hoarseness\n 3. Sore throat\n 4. Nasal obstruction\n 5. Sneezing\n 6. Increased tissue usage\n 7. Nasal stuffiness\n 8. Sinus Pain\n 9. Post-nasal discharge\n 10.

Temperature increase in the day\n 20. Temperature increase at night\n\n[Table 3, ibid]\n\nNot a single one of these is actually caused \"directly\" by the virus, but it kind of get's back to what can the virus do?  Viruses are very small obligate parasites that rely on changing host systems to replicate and spread their genetic material.\n\nIf we take a look at the snotty, cough, and sneezy symptoms (cough, bronchoconstriction and airway mucus secretion), they are all \"[caused][11]\" by [rapidly adapting receptors][12] (RARs) along the airway.  That is to say, the damage the viruses do actually cause to cells along the airway is detected by RARs either through the cell debris, chemical signaling (indirect activation from other cells), or direct interaction of immune cells.\n\nIf we look at a runny and stuffed up nose (rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction) specifically, [we know][13] that [neutrophils][14] are coming to the sinuses and inducing inflammation and mucus over production.\n\nWhat do the viruses actually do then?\n-------------------------------------\nThis is where the question gets very broad very quickly.  I will deal with three viruses as examples: HRV, RSV, and influenza.  Some of the best sentinel data on colds, at least [colds severe enough][15] to seek medical treatment, has been coming from China. The two leading candidates from [these studies][16] are HRV and RSV (also true in US, see a related [SE.BIO awnser][17] of mine).  I want add in flu because it has some other interesting traits.\n\nBoth HRV and RSV often are [found with co-infection][16] of other viruses or bacteria, but RSV is more likely to have this problem [ibid].  While \"drained\" resources while fighting the common infection might be a partial explanation for this, [we know][18] that RSV produces two proteins, NS1 and NS2, which directly inhibit the innate immune system.  This could explain the high rate of co-infection with RSV.  Which leads me to the first general thing that viruses do, directly counter the immune system of a host.\n\nAnother [comparison][19] would be what kind of direct cell damage ([cytopathology][20]) the virus might do.  [RSV][21] and [flu][19] tends to destroy the airway epithelial barrier by infecting and killing the epithelial cells (this sets of the RARs).  HRV on the other hand, doesn't often kill the cells off, but just disrupts their function [ibid].  Thus the second general thing viruses do is \"kill\" or \"disrupt\" the cells they infect.\n\nThe final action of a virus I want to look at goes back to a symptom that is on our list, myalgia.  Of our three viruses, this is most closely associated with flu.  Though the exact mechanisms may vary, it is [believed][22] to be caused [cytokine][23] release.\n\nHere's a good example where answering the question of what is \"caused\" by the virus is tricky.  Some influenza strains produce proteins where a main function seems to be inducing cytokines.  This can lead to all kinds of bad things like a [cytokine storm][24].  But flu also needs to cause an up regulation of [trypsin][25] to help process it's proteins.  This might be done indirectly through a cytokine or directly from a viral protein.  Either way the trypsin can remain in the tissue causing damage to host proteins after the virus has moved on (been cleared).  So would we say this was tissue damage caused by the virus?  It wasn't an immune response in the normal sense, and it was started by the virus, but then again the trypsin is not a viral protein.\n\nThat leads to my final overly generic statement about viruses, they activate complicated pathways with all kinds of incidental downstream consequences (normally bad).  Imagine if someone was in front of a power breaker box randomly turning off and on switches.  If the food was spoiled in the refrigerator would you say it was because the refrigerator wasn't on, or because somebody pulled the fuse out?\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.cmu.edu/common-cold-project/how-to-use-this-website/index.html\n  [2]: http://www.cmu.edu/common-cold-project/publications/index.html\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus\n  [4]: http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/protozoology/notes/Path.html\n  [5]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2271186/?page=7\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2271186/\n  [8]: http://www.uofmmedicalcenter.org/HealthLibrary/Article/511842EN\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucopurulent_discharge\n  [11]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11240151\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor#By_rate_of_adaptation\n  [13]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378761/\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte\n  [15]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750056/\n  [16]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321179\n  [17]: https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/21507/why-dont-we-develop-immunity-against-common-cold/21802#21802\n  [18]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557722\n  [19]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2158258\n  [20]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology\n  [21]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17557802\n  [22]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530048\n  [23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine\n  [24]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm\n  [25]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin", "4506": "TSH concentration is subject to both circadian variation (i.e. a rhythm with a period of one day) and ultradian variation (i.e. faster oscillations).\n\nThis fact is illustrated by the following figure:\n\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\n\nThis illustration was generated by computer simulations.

Note that the mean in the spontaneously improving group would have been considered \u201cless than assay\u201d in a test with a detection limit of 35 IU/mL. \n\nSo yes, \u201csomewhere between 9 and 35 IU/mL is actually not that bad\u201d, if \u201cbad\u201d refers to a titer greater than 35 IU/mL and the relative prognostic value is of interest.\n\n----\n<sub>\n* Many lab tests have a lower limit of detection within the physiologic range like this. These tend to be looking for antibodies or enzymes that are not *supposed* to be present at a detectable level. In such cases the \u201cnormal\u201d result is \u201cLTA = less than assay\u201d. As lab tests get better and that detection limit goes lower, more people end up characterized as \u201cabnormal\u201d. Such is scientific progress.\n</sub>\n\n------\n<sub>\n1.

One is then forced to use more theoretical arguments, but because medical science is not  a hard science like physics, such arguments are not very reliable. The best we can then do is argue from biological plausibility, in this case we should take serious the fact that Homo Sapiens evolved more than 200,000 years ago while people only started to take baths relatively recently. The adaptation via natural selection over hundreds of millions years since the first land animals evolved is thus still relevant for us. The human microbiome consisting of all the microbes that live on our skins, in our intestines is known to play non-trivial roles, but we don't know a lot about how this impacts our health (from rigorous randomly controlled trials) \n\nThis means that the null hypothesis should assume that never washing, bathing or taking showers is beneficial for health over even occasionally doing so. You should need strong evidence to overturn this null hypothesis. Such strong evidence is lacking, what evidence there is there is consistent with this null hypothesis.

In order to understand the answer, a little background is necessary.\n\n**Why does the body become unable to produce cortisone?**  \nAs in many endocrine systems, negative feedback maintains homeostasis. Exogenous GCs exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a series of hormones starting in the hypothalamus) that normally stimulates GC production in the adrenals. This negative feedback is almost immediately reversible. However, with extended administration of exogenous GCs, the lack of stimulation via the HPA axis leads to atrophy of the adrenal gland, and it becomes unable to produce the horomone *even when the feedback suppression is removed*. Your question is, **how much exogenous GC is required to produce this effect?**\n\nIt\u2019s a very practical question because it affects how doctors prescribe steroids. *If* adrenal suppression is expected, they must be tapered slowly. *If not*, a \u201cburst\u201d can be administered and then immediately stopped. Because it\u2019s such a practical question, people thought to study it quite a while ago, and the relevant literature is mostly pretty old (relative to most biomedical data, at least). (See below.)\n\nThe time required to achieve suppression depends upon:  \n\n- the dose; \n- the length of time administered; and  \n- factors unique to each patient, probably resulting from (ultimately genetic) differences in their rates of GC metabolism.\n\n**Who is likely to be suppressed: some general guidelines**\n\n**Not suppressed**  \n\n- GC treatment (any dose) for less than three weeks.   \n- Treatment with less than 10 mg total daily dose (prednisone equivalents) for any time period.\n\n**Suppressed**\n\n- Oral GC treatment of >20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks  \n- Any patient with clinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome (see [this answer][oa] for description)\n\n**Uncertain suppression**: The degree of suppression in this intermediate group is related to individual metabolism parameters that are not (yet!) established in a way that can be measured and used clinically.  \n\n- Less than 20 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) for >3 weeks.\n- Any dose for >3 weeks administered every other day.\n\nThe rule of thumb I learned (which is fairly conservative): >10 mg for >3 weeks requires tapering.  \n\nIn those patients who fall into the uncertain category, there is something called a \"cosyntropin stimulation test\u201d that helps make the distinction. In this test, a doctor administers a hormone (cosyntropin, a.k.a. ACTH) that stimulates the adrenal gland and measures plasma cortisol concentrations to see if it responds appropriately.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking in prednisone \u201cequivalents.\u201d There are [steroid equivalent converters](http://www.medcalc.com/steroid.html) around. In general, prednisolone and prednisone have a 1:1 dosing relationship. \n\nThe answer to your question, then, is **no**. Seven days is a common prescription for a steroid \u201cburst\u201d, and tapering is generally considered to be unnecessary. \n\n\n-----\n<sub>\nAckerman GL, Nolsn CM.

To keep this scientific, though, let's divide your question into three addressable points:\n\n 1. Does the placebo effect work?\n 2. Does the placebo effect work on you?\n 3. Can the placebo effect be scientifically tested?\n\nIf each of these points can be resolved as true, then it would be fair to call the question answered. Also, at the bottom you'll find some suggestions for a placebo self-test.\n\n### What is a Placebo, What is the Placebo Effect?\n\nA placebo is a treatment that looks like a regular treatment, but is actually an inactive look-alike, and not a medicine. Placebos are used in medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, as often some of the benefit from a treatment will actually be due to the placebo effect. In a controlled trial, some trial subjects are given the treatment being tested, and some are given placebos. Ideally, the subjects can't tell the difference, and at the end of the study, the effectiveness of the drug can be compared to that of the placebo.[<sup>1</sup>][1]\n\nIn practice, this often means sugar or cornstarch pills, but can extend to other treatments as well. In fact, even surgical procedures can be placebos. Known as sham surgeries, surgical placebos often involve the administration of anesthesia followed by several incisions similar to those that would be made during typical surgery.[<sup>2</sup>][2]\n\nWhat is the placebo effect that makes all of this necessary? The placebo effect is the improvement in a medical condition resulting from the *belief* that one is being treated, rather than the effectiveness of the treatment itself.[<sup>3</sup>][3] Because patients tend to believe they are being given an effective treatment, this belief itself contributes to improvement in condition.[<sup>4</sup>][4]\n\n### Does the Placebo Effect Work?\n\nA number of examples can be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the placebo effect. Several of them conclude that not only is the placebo effect powerful, it is sometimes more powerful than the medication alternatives.[<sup>5</sup>][5]\n\nA migraine study conducted in 2014 compared the effect of the migraine treatment rizatriptan (sold by Merck Pharmaceuticals as Maxalt) to a placebo, by administering envelopes with drugs in them to migraine sufferers. The subjects were instructed to take the medication in case of migraine. The envelopes came in pairs labeled 'Placebo', 'Maxalt' or 'Placebo or Maxalt', however, each pair actually had one placebo envelope and one Maxalt envelope. Yet, subjects reported the same level of pain relief from placebo labeled Maxalt as from Maxalt labeled placebo, suggesting that placebos are sometimes as effective as actual medication. Patients also reported pain relief from the placebo labeled placebo, suggesting that even one who knowingly takes a placebo can still be subject to the effect.[<sup>6</sup>][6]\n\nA study specifically designed to evaluate the placebo effect compared fake acupuncture to fake pills, a comparison of two placebos. Subjects suffering from arm pain were either prescribed acupuncture or pain medication, but the pain medication was cornstarch pills, and the acupuncture used needles with tips that retract into themselves upon touching skin, like stage knives. The subjects were warned about possible side effects of the treatment, with the side effects mentioned taken from actual side effects of either real treatment. Interestingly, one third of patients reported the exact side effects they were warned about, including excessive drowsiness in the pill group, and redness and inflammation in the acupuncture group, even though the skin wasn't actually pierced. Some patients in both groups reported extreme pain, but more interestingly, most of the subjects reported extreme pain relief.[<sup>7</sup>][7]\n\n### Does the Placebo Effect Work on You?\n\nAn effective method of proving widespread viability of the placebo effect is showcasing its virality, quite literally. When one believes he is sick, and starts developing actual symptoms as a result, the medical community refers to this condition as 'psychogenic illness,' or actual illness spawned from the belief of illness. When this believed illness is believed to be contagious, anyone who hears about it can himself become ill, experiencing the full range of purported symptoms. This is known as 'sociogenic illness', and it is potentially the most infectious category of illness in existence. This is because it \"infects\" through information, making mass media often the single greatest transmission vector. Most worryingly, the current medical opinion is that there is no particular predisposition to mass sociogenic illness and it is a behavioral condition that anyone can show in the right circumstances.[<sup>8</sup>][8]\n\nA 2006 study testing individual sensitivity to GSM cellphone signals found no evidence that people with self-reported sensitivity to mobile phone signals are able to detect such signals or that they react to them with increased symptom severity. As sham exposure was sufficient to trigger severe symptoms in some participants, this condition was most likely sociogenic illness.[<sup>9</sup>][9]\n\nA 2012 study testing whether media coverage of people sensitive to WiFi signal contributed to reports of WiFi sensitivity concluded that media reports about the adverse effects of supposedly hazardous substances can increase the likelihood of experiencing symptoms following sham exposure and developing an apparent sensitivity to it.[<sup>10</sup>][10]\n\nA case study about mass illness attributed to toxic exposure at a high school had features of mass psychogenic illness. Notably, widespread subjective symptoms thought to be associated with environmental exposure to a toxic substance persisted in the absence of objective evidence of an environmental cause.[<sup>11</sup>][11]\n\nIn other words, sociogenic and psychogenic illness exist, there is no particular predisposition to mass sociogenic illness and it is a behavioral condition that anyone can show in the right circumstances.[<sup>12</sup>][12]\n\n### Can the Placebo Effect be Scientifically Tested?\n\nAll of the previous studies seem to indicate that yes, the placebo effect can be scientifically tested, but as a final confirmation, a study conducted on subjects with Alzheimer's disease showed that these subjects got less pain relief from pain medications. They required higher doses, possibly because they had forgotten that they were getting the drugs, or they forgot that the pain medicines had worked for them before.[<sup>13</sup>][13]\n\nIn other words, Alzheimer's disease seems to allow the comparison of placebo effect and the lack thereof. Because Alzheimer's disease patients do not remember taking their medication, they receive far less benefit from it due to the lost contributions from the placebo effect.\n\n### A Suggestion of Methods\n\nNow that we've scientifically proven that the placebo effect works, it is powerful, and it by all means should work for you, even if you know you are or may be taking a placebo, we may devise some methods.\n\nYou will likely need an external source of entropy, and should most likely not use a placebo in place of actual necessary treatment. This would mean that you will want a medication that does not cure any particular disease, though maybe alleviating symptoms is a better bet. I assume that this is why the studies above tend to stick with pain relief for evaluating placebos. Pain relief is easy to judge and quantify on a personal level, and the lack thereof does not threaten anyone's life. If you are injured and in pain, there is your test.\n\nIf you are not injured, however, and have no desire to be,[<sup>14</sup>][14] you may want to try medication that causes noticeable benefit rather than treatment. For example, caffeine. Find two coffees, one caffeinated, one decaffeinated, that you can't tell tell apart with taste alone. Ideally, add something with a strong taste masking ability to each to help prevent differentiation. Have a friend divide up the two coffees into numbered plastic bags, one bag for each day of the experiment, without you knowing which bags are which. Also, it is important to prevent bias that you not be able to connect different days of the experiment, so no evens and odds. Your friend's numbering system should be sufficiently random that you can't figure out which bags are which. When you are ready, begin the experiment, using a bag of your choice for each day of the experiment. Chart, on an hourly basis, the amount of \"buzz\" you experience from that coffee number, and after maybe a month try to take a guess using the chart at which bag numbers were caffeinated and which were decaffeinated. Then, ask for your friend's table of which were which, and evaluate.\n\nThis was just a suggestion, but this and similar study designs should by all means allow you to test the placebo effect on yourself. Feel free to experiment, that's how science progresses.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/placebo-effect\n  [2]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422430/\n  [3]: http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/complementary-alternative-medicine/pages/placebo-effect.aspx\n  [4]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-sense/201201/the-placebo-effect-how-it-works\n  [5]: http://blogs.nature.com/spoonful/2014/01/migraine-study-attributes-more-than-half-a-drugs-benefit-to-placebo-effect.html\n  [6]: http://blogs.nature.com/spoonful/2014/01/migraine-study-attributes-more-than-half-a-drugs-benefit-to-placebo-effect.html\n  [7]: http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon\n  [8]: http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/4/300.full\n  [9]: http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7546/886?view=long&pmid=16520326\n  [10]: http://www.jpsychores.com/article/S0022-3999(12)00335-2/fulltext\n  [11]: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200001133420206\n  [12]: http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/4/300.full\n  [13]: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/placebo-effect\n  [14]: http://guides.library.jhu.edu/c.php?g=202502&p=1335759", "280": "Probably some of the more common causes would be poor diet and lack exercise. Not everyone who eats poorly and doesn't exercise will be over weight since genetics plays a role. That is, a young adult can appear to be healthy but be internally suffering. Another question would be is this otherwise health individual a smoker?\n\n>Two recent studies confirm the blood pressure benefits of maintaining a healthy diet. First is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical study, which tested the effects of food nutrients on blood pressure. It emphasizes consumption of fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy foods, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and stresses reduction of fats, red meats, sweets, and sugared beverages.\n>\n>Second is the DASH-sodium study, which demonstrates the importance of lowering sodium (salt) intake. Most Americans consume far more than the current, daily recommendation of 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium\u2014about a teaspoon of table salt\u2014or less. This includes all salt and sodium consumed, not just at the table, but also in cooking. For those with high blood pressure, consuming even less may be advisable, since the DASH-sodium study revealed that diets containing no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day had still greater pressure-lowering effects.\n>\n>Regular physical activity is another good step toward controlling or even preventing high blood pressure. Start with 30 minutes of moderate-level activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling or gardening on most\u2014preferably all\u2014days of the week. The activity even may be divided into three, 10-minute periods each. For added benefit, these moderate half-hours may be increased or supplanted by regular, vigorous exercise. Of course, prior to upping the activity level, people should check with their physicians, especially if they have had heart trouble or a previous heart attack, a family history of heart disease at an early age, or other serious health problems.\n>\n>Another healthy move is to limit alcohol intake. Excess alcohol can raise blood pressure as well as damage the liver, heart, and brain. Drinks should be kept to a maximum of one per day for women, and two for men. (One drink equals 12 ounces of beer or five ounces of wine.)\n>\n>Finally, quit smoking. Among other things, smoking damages blood vessel walls and speeds hardening of the arteries. Ceasing smoking reduces the risk of heart attack in just one year [[1]](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/fall11/articles/fall11pg10-11.html).\n\nI would say this would probably be the most common causes of a young, health adult presenting with asymptomatic hypertension; however, there can be other reasons as well. For instance, another cause could be [paraganglioma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraganglioma). The NIH presented a case of a 19 year old female with asymptomatic severe hypertension in 2010. The woman had a BP of 220/140 mmHg. Her lab results showed elevated plasma norepinephrine, 1807 pg/ml, and 24h urinary free catecholamines, 483 ug/24h. After resection of the tumor, the patients BP was normal during followup.
